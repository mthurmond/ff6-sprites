This is an ode to my favirite video game: Final Fantasy 6 for snes. You can view the character sprites, read their backstory, and listen to their theme song. 

Thanks to [video game sprites](http://www.videogamesprites.net/FinalFantasy6/) for the images, [fandom](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Wiki) for the character details,  and [zophar](https://www.zophar.net/music/nintendo-snes-spc/final-fantasy-vi) for the audio.
