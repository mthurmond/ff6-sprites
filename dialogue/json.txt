So I told him!","1603":"Oh, hello again! Yep, you were tops!","1605":"Quick! Fix that chair! Then you can use it to reach the roof.","1629":"Who'n blazes 'r you? Oh! The repairman!","1632":"What is this?! What's with this \"son\" business? I never had a son!","1633":"But now that you mention it, I once had a terrible dream. In it, a demon-child was born! I grabbed the creature, and rushed off to the Veldt with it\u2026It was crying like crazy when I arrived on the Veldt.","1635":"I left the child there... And without looking back, I turned and started to run.","1637":"Suddenly the crying stopped. I turned around and saw a frightful monster... Hideous! Still gives me the shakes.\u00a0SABIN\u00a0I give up...","1638":"But you, young man, your parents must be proud of you! I still have dreams of that demon child...Frightening...","1642":"Eh?

Maybe they can help you, there.","286":"My people are dying to know what the Esper looks like.","495":"I never said...that!","1902":"Makes sense. Can't just forget about Espers...","280":"Banon! King Edgar! ...and Terra!!!","282":"The town's neutral. I've tried to get the people to side with the Returners, but... Anyway, why on earth have you come here?","284":"They all went...slightly berserk when the Esper was discovered.","1899":"It was like this when we got here.","793":"I see... Your plan would combine Narshe's money with Figaro's machinery to storm the Empire... not enough manpower, though...","1882":"The sealed gate stands at the eastern edge of the Empire.

And you are that last ray of light, our only hope...","1760":"I see...","206":"Stay where you are! Perhaps you've heard this story? Once, when people were pure and innocent, there was a box they were told never to open. But one man went and opened it anyway.

Will you become our last ray of hope?","511":"Locke. Where'd you hear that?","1758":"Who did this? Who left this piece of paper here?","231":"It's all right now.","1813":"Go find Terra! She holds the future to our survival.","1788":"What? What's that noise?","794":"We have to open the sealed gate...","1881":"Get the Espers to understand, and we can bring this war to a screeching halt. Terra... I know you can do this...","792":"Oh, you're here! The people of Narshe have finally decided to battle the Empire. How did it go at Vector...?","285":"We believe this young woman is our only hope of reaching out to that Esper.","281":"Arvis! What's happening here in Narshe?","797":"When the gate has been opened, the Espers can attack from the east. We'll storm in at the same time, from the north.","1898":"What ARE you talking about...?! ......!! Talking with...Espers...?","798":"We MUST get the Espers to understand. We have to establish a bond of trust between humans and Espers. Only one person can do this...","1785":"Who can say? Regardless, we need Terra's help.","1411":"Aye yai yai...","1409":"Wait a sec!","238":"You should know better than any of us!

I have a bad feeling about this...","226":"We've no time to dilly-dally. Let's make for Narshe!","224":"Right. There's a raft by the back entrance. It's a gamble, but we're fresh out of options...","203":"Carrier pigeons brought word that she wiped out 50 of the Empire's best soldiers in a few minutes.","222":"What're we going to do?","1901":"Could Gestahl have meant such a thing? Team up with the Empire to track down an Esper... Hmm...","201":"Is she the girl who can talk to Espers...?!","1770":"I have a plan! Please get everyone together!","526":"They're after the Esper.","1780":"It's just speculation... But historical studies have provided a number of conflicting and frightening theories... According to one theory, humans and machines were imbued with powers drained from Espers...","1777":"Indeed! The ancient War of the Magi...","1771":"We all know that the Empire is using Magitek power in battle. The point is, how has the Emperor created it?","1783":"It's risky, but if we have Terra...speak with that Esper, it might just wake up...","1769":"A lucky charm. Take it!","539":"They're coming!","1775":"I can only recall one thing linking Espers with Magitek power...","1699":"You don't have to pretend. I know. I've lost...too much blood.","1702":"Before you go... You have to use your knife\u2026","1687":"Clyde...I'm... done for... F...find me here... Please, Clyde...","1690":"Guess it's time to change our name.","1697":"I've let you down... I'm sorry...","1705":"Are you...shaking? I can't believe it! You're acting like a coward!

Is...is this MY blood...?","1704":"Think what they'll do to me if I get caught. I don't want to go through that. Do me this favor.","1692":"We need something more...appropriate. Such as...? ... Shadow! Not bad, huh?","1708":"Clyde! How dare you!?","1688":"Yahoooo! We did it, Clyde!","1701":"You wanna get caught?","1216":"Come on, let's go...","612":"Then you're history!","1181":"I'll go catch some.","665":"Wait! We were told your ship is the finest vessel in the world.","1174":"I suppose so, Cid...Or should I say, Granddad?! May I call you that?","1219":"Come along with us! We're after Kefka!","1191":"Only Edgar would say, \"my lady.\"","605":"If we could get that airship, we'd make the Empire in no time.","1221":"What are you saying?!\u00a0SETZER\u00a0I'm just a gambler...I just want to be left alone...This world is too chaotic for me. What's worse, I've lost my wings...","1223":"But before the world collapsed, you fought with all your heart! You were absolutely fearless...","1225":"You want to live in this world as it is? No? Then do something about it!","1179":"What would you like?","600":"Are you talking to me?","1112":"What's wrong, Terra?","1217":"Setzer!\u00a0SETZER\u00a0You're alive!?","663":"Setzer, we need your help.

Eat up!","654":"That's HIM...?!","1189":"Don't play possum with me! Edgar? Or have you somehow lost your memory?","632":"On with the show! This is a big scene in which Maria senses that something's happened to Draco!","658":"Enough already!","630":"Somewhere inside you were saving...her, weren't you...?","628":"Locke. Why did you help me escape back there?","1207":"Edgar! It IS you!","1208":"Why the stupid farce?","622":"W...wait! I'm a GENERAL, not some opera floozy!","1210":"You needed to use them...","1079":"He was so gentle...","250":"How can you serve those cowards...","252":"Isn't it true Kefka's going to poison the people of Doma, to the east?","255":"Returners!!! I used to be General Celes... Now I'm just a common traitor...","257":"!? You'd take me along?","258":"Thanks, but no thanks. I can barely walk...","259":"I'm grateful, but... Even if you got me out, you'd never be able to protect me. No, I think I'm better off here.","263":"This soldier has something important on him...","265":"Why are you helping me?","269":"Something's coming outta the wall!!","270":"TunnelArmr!! I'll draw its magic attack. It won't hurt us.","274":"Just you watch!!","620":"Now just a minute...","661":"He's coming.","1186":"Y... you're Edgar, aren't you?!","1229":"This person...She was your friend?","1408":"This passage leads out.","1126":"Emperor Gestahl! Please, stop this madness!","1256":"I...don't know...! Something inside just tells me it's important...","685":"I think you've been hustled, Mr. Gambler.","1169":"The world...! So, it wasn't just a dream.","683":"I win! Now, honor your part of the bargain!","1170":"Where are my friends? Where's Locke...?","1338":"What will happen to ... Terra...?","679":"But I have conditions...","1335":"I'm really not sure, but...","1333":"The Statues give the Espers the magical energy they need to live. If we destroy the Statues...","1316":"Locke...That's for Rachel, isn't it...?","557":"She looked like... an Esper...","1254":"Setzer! Follow that bird!","556":"She changed into a...something, and...took off. She looked like...","552":"An Esper......I can actually feel its mind......","670":"Stop thinking of yourself. Many towns and villages have been smashed by the Empire.","1172":"My friends...they're probably all gone...","1176":"My long-lost Granddad...","673":"We all hate the Empire for the same reasons. That's why...","538":"Fine. Use your own eyes, then decide.","536":"??? What's that supposed to mean?!","534":"When I was a baby I was artificially infused with magic, and raised as a Magitek Knight.","532":"So, you were born with the power of magic!? Isn't it a lovely gift...","677":"We haven't any choice.","530":"I'm a soldier, not some love-starved twit!","554":"You're awake?","1123":"I came to stop you!","1166":"A whole year...You've watched over me the whole time?","704":"Professor Cid.\u00a0CID\u00a0General Celes! And who might these dubious characters be? Your troops?","1131":"Power only breeds war... I wish I'd never been...born.","598":"Why are you coming with me?","596":"So...how we gonna get there? The Empire's on the continent to the south. No boats go there...","1406":"And you are...","1404":"What do you hope to peddle down here?","1402":"You're awfully short for a soldier.","591":"I'll go to the Empire. I know it well...","1394":"Terra, your strength is going!","1393":"Terra! It's okay! Your power! It's fading...","1377":"Both buttons have to be pressed simultaneously...","1375":"It won't open!","1164":"I...feel like I've been sleeping for ever...","1366":"You mean Terra too?","1364":"Terra! What's wrong?","1249":"We can attack Kefka's tower from the air!","1363":"Come on, everybody! We have to work together!","716":"Locke... Let me protect you for once... Maybe now... Now you'll believe me...","713":"Locke... Please believe me...","711":"Of course not! Have a little faith!","1155":"Snap out of it, Kefka!","1253":"Hey! A bird!","1350":"I've met someone who can accept me for what I am.","1156":"Oh, that's really smart, Kefka! Disturb their delicate balance, and they'll go haywire...!","705":"No...

Well...","1982":"I'm glad I made it this far...I feel I have a lot to live for...","1545":"What's up?","1548":"No...NO!! You promised you'd stay here with me!!","1041":"Please, not another word.","1847":"He traded his power, so that others might live...","1547":"Granddad. You have to eat, or else... W...what's the matter?","1549":"Granddad, ANSWER ME! Tell me you're just joking!","1270":"G'fu, fu, fu... Who're these numbskulls? No one...NO ONE...is going to remove me from this fine new painting!!","135":"No one can touch the people of Figaro!","1415":"The whole business of the succession was so repugnant to Sabin, the King's brother, that...... ......he fled the castle forever. The succession was settled with a coin toss...","636":"Prince Ralse is looking for a dance partner. Leave the past behind! Our kingdom is adopting the spirit of the East...!","1509":"Welcome back, King Edgar!","1510":"Huh!? Sabin... What a splendid young man you've become!","1511":"Make yourselves at home here.","1724":"Yahoo! Yippy!!!!","1717":"I want it...I want it! Buy it! Pretty please!!","1720":"Yahoo!!! Thanks, Papa! Yahoo!","1715":"Papa!! I want that! Please!","849":"You seem a bit tired. Care for a rest break?","1175":"Gramps, eh? I'm overwhelmed! All of a sudden I have a granddaughter! Cough... Wheeze...","1173":"Celes...you're the closest thing to family that I have...we could just live out our lives here peacefully...","720":"Quick! Over here!","719":"This is a disaster! Your fighting has caused the capsules to rupture! Their contents are spilling out!","1911":"I'll help. No machine can stump me!","701":"What are you doing there?","718":"Ooh, ooh... What happened?","1163":"You're finally awake!","1915":"But I could really make this thing hum...!","724":"Celes... I've known her since she was a baby. I raised her as if she was my own daughter! But she was forced to become a Magitek Knight, and has done some awful things. If I could only talk to her... I'd apologize for the way her life has turned out.","702":"W...what's this!?","1165":"For one year, actually... I thought you were out for good.","703":"So...Esper magical power can only truly be transferred when one of them passes away...","1913":"Go kill time in the casino! I can speed this crate up!","723":"You've helped me come to a decision. I'm going to talk to the Emperor and have this stupid war stopped!","1167":"Yes, and I'm about out of energy.","1168":"We're on a tiny, deserted island. After the world crumbled, I awoke to find us here together with......a few strangers.","706":"Can it be true that you came here as a spy, seeking to cause an uprising?!","725":"No! It's Kefka!","1171":"I don't know. I only know we're here... Maybe we're the only people left alive...Since that day, the world's continued its slide into ruin. Animals and plants are dying...The few others who washed up here with us passed away of boredom and despair.","1162":"Celes...at last...!","1177":"Ha, ha...hack...cough!\u00a0CELES\u00a0Hey, are you hungry?","722":"The life-energy of those Espers...","1544":"Oh! Yum... Chomp, munch, chew...","1178":"I...haven't eaten in 3 or so days, ever since I became ill.","1554":"Those others who were here... when they were feeling down they'd take a leap of faith from the cliffs up north...perked 'em right up!","827":"The Emperor's had a change of heart...","828":"The Espers came to save their friends. When they learned the others had perished, they went berserk, and trashed the town... Never will I forget their shrieks of rage...","831":"No human's going to make them sit down and listen...","1552":"That Locke fellow, too, no doubt...","1909":"Wow, what a ship!","1550":"Celes... You must leave this place. You have to find your friends!","1180":"Well, unless I ask for fish, I won't get anything! That's all there is here!\u00a0CELES\u00a0I'll go catch some.","1535":"I feel much better! Thanks, Celes!","1537":"Celes, thanks for all you've done for me!","1538":"Hackack!! I feel a little better!","1539":"Cough...wheeze...I can't bear this any longer...","1540":"I...I'm not long for this cruel new world...","1541":"My worst nightmare is to think of you alone here on this wretched island...hack...wheeze!!","1542":"Cough...hack...ACK!! While I can still talk, I...wheeze...pant...want to thank you...cough!","1546":"Celes...the project that kept me going over the past year is down below. Go have a look at it!","1536":"My dear, I...feel I'm not going to be around much longer...","1528":"All will be put right if we can achieve peace...!","721":"Kefka has used me... used the Empire. What have I done...?","833":"There're some people here who'd prefer to keep fighting. Please, before we dine, talk to as many soldiers as you can! Make them understand!","836":"You can count me in as a Returner!","1696":"You're gonna be okay!","1691":"Our name?","1693":"Great train robbers of the century... Shadow...?","1703":"WHAT!!!!","1694":"Open your eyes!","1689":"A million GP! What a blast! I love this!","1698":"Save your strength. We're almost to a town.","1706":"I CAN'T!","1707":"I'm sorry...","302":"You two! We're about to storm Doma Castle...","1737":"I am Gogo, master of the simulacrum... My miming skills will astonish you.","393":"Sir Sabin!! It is I who is in your debt!","391":"Sir Sabin! How might these abominations be manipulated?","430":"Please, wait!","399":"Narshe, eh? Only one route, through the forest to the south.","389":"Sir Sabin! What on earth are these?","1803":"I will avenge the people of Doma!!","396":"Aaahhh! We can't stop now!","378":"Ohhh! This is too much!","385":"But what of my home, my family...my friends?","432":"To the south is the Veldt. Dangerous creatures there.","383":"Thank you, kind sir!","406":"Sir Sabin!","382":"The thought had occurred to me as well!","404":"Sir Sabin!","408":"Sir Sabin!","410":"Let me off! This train's haunted!","412":"If we don't get off now...","414":"We're too late.","416":"This is the Phantom Train... It carries the departed to...the other side.","380":"What a mess!! Be careful, Sir!!","1370":"You just have to show technology who's boss!!","1369":"Machines... I HATE machines!","434":"If we can slip through the Veldt, we can reach the town of Mobliz, to the east...","1875":"Whoa! What IS that?!","425":"Gulp...where are we?","401":"A train's there!? But I thought Doma's railway had been destroyed...?","381":"Urgh!!! Who released this poison?","418":"We all have to go sometime...","428":"No!!! Elayne! Owain!!","507":"Kefka poisoned...everyone...","437":"I'm Cyan and he's Sabin.","513":"Grrr! I knew she seemed familiar. Sir Gau, out of my way!","514":"This's General Celes! She torched Maranda! She's an Imperial spy! Now, stand aside!","537":"Don't think for a moment I trust you!","547":"Can it still be alive?","563":"A former Imperial soldier... But we've no choice. We must help her!","1265":"As I wrote to that girl, I realized I was very much like her. I was looking behind...full of despair. My eyes were closed... And then something changed...","1264":"I learned of that poor girl when I passed through Maranda. When I heard that she sent a letter each day, but never received any replies... Something inside me snapped...","1263":"Mm...m...!? This is an outrage...!","1262":"These... they're... um... Merely a diversion of mine...","1261":"I shall go with you! I shan't leave the world as it is! But how did you find me? W...wait! Tell me you didn't read my letters...!!","1260":"Hey!! You're alive!?","1867":"I'm one of Doma's Knights. Please, help us.","589":"Then we're going in...","594":"You need a hand?","1846":"He traded his power, so that others might live...","1908":"...... That wasn't your fault.","1980":"What an amazing device!","377":"Thank you... whomever you are.","436":"Thou art so......odd.","505":"I'm Cyan, retainer to the lord of Doma!","492":"I'm sure they did.","1874":"See! I knew she couldn't be trusted!","1618":"What a jaunty hat!","1346":"My family lives on inside of me.","450":"Simmer down, sirs! And thou, o wild one...... who might thou be?","1619":"Wait a minute! Where's the hat?","1756":"Look to the future...We have a lot of life left to live...","461":"Look! We can't have ye two prancing 'round all day! Gau, I think we're going to get on well together. Why don't you join us?","470":"I think he's trying to tell us something!","682":"That man uses people...","1809":"We have to help her!","473":"Look, let's just go along with him to this Crescent Mountain.","1757":"No! That's mine!!!","479":"Uh, Sir Gau, where exactly is it?","481":"Is this it? Gau's \"treasure\"?","482":"Looks like glass...","490":"Narshe is just a stone's throw away!","1870":"...I lost my friends... and my family.","1832":"Is Miss Terra okay?","373":"We can't forgive this! The Empire must pay!","420":"I believe we're stuck!","371":"D... Dear me...","1796":"I'm not like that!","1939":"The Empire deserves the worst!","1463":"Here, too...","1467":"Eeoooa! Be you friend or enemy?!","1472":"Be these time schedules?","311":"Walled up in there, we can wait out our enemy!","309":"I am Cyan, retainer to the King of Doma. I am your worst nightmare...","307":"Thou musn't give up the fight!","306":"Let us give it a try.","305":"If we can fell their commander, they'll surely give up.","1476":"Sir Sabin! Maybe we shouldn't fumble with that!","1478":"How can you...!?","1479":"How could you...","1481":"How dare you?! Just because I respect other beings' property doesn't mean I'm not mechanically minded!","1483":"SILENCE...! H...how could you tell?","1485":"Seems to want to come with us.","1491":"A...are you going to be okay if you eat THIS?","1794":"ir Sabin... Recall that you had me hold onto your pouch. Here.\u00a0NPC\u00a0This is Nikeah, one of the world's few port towns.\u00a0NPC\u00a0We used to be a trading town, but the Empire shut us down.\u00a0NPC\u00a0The land to the east, Doma, fell to the Empire.\u00a0NPC\u00a0Move along, now. You're in the way!\u00a0NPC\u00a0No one can reach Nikeah unless they have a ship!\u00a0NPC\u00a0A rock slide has blocked the path leading north.\u00a0NPC\u00a0The path leading north is now clear.\u00a0NPC\u00a0The Empire has overrun our destination.\u00a0NPC\u00a0Nikeah-bound ferry.","1792":"Oh, dear. Sir Sabin, let me handle this.","1084":"Thanks to Edgar, we escaped before anything bad happened...","1891":"I could feel the warrior spirits of those Espers!","1736":"Elayne and Owain live on in my heart. I must leave the past behind. I have much to live for...","1090":"Sir Leo?! Gone?! What a waste...He was their finest soldier...","348":"Huh? The water looks odd...","1735":"No...I didn't do anything...then...and I can't now...I'm a man with no honor...","1733":"Thanks be to you.","1885":"What an eerie place...","861":"We'll stay here and investigate.","372":"I...impossible! Idiotic!!!","1496":"A...are you going to be okay if you eat THIS?","1493":"Hummm... Sir! I won't hear any more of this kind of talk!","1734":"I heard my wife and children calling out to me! Their voices finally gave me the strength and courage to come to grips with my own suffering.","350":"This is... POISON!","1854":"Going somewhere? I'm going to relax!","355":"Your Highness! Fear not!","363":"Save your strength! Don't talk!","361":"Not yet, Highness!","370":"! Owain... NOT YOU TOO! Son...you can't BOTH leave me!","366":"There have to be some survivors in the castle!","359":"Excellency! Hang on!","369":"This... This...can't be happening!","357":"Cyan, Excellency.","368":"Elayne! Elayne! Wake up!","352":"Guard our liege!","354":"Right! The King's room is near!","1238":"Big talk, buster!","1240":"Come on! Stop lagging back there!","1243":"This time's for real. I'm going to break every record! I'll be known as the woman who flew closest to the stars!","1241":"Or do you like chewing on my wake!","1236":"If something should happen to me, the Falcon's yours!","1233":"This experimental airship is probably a bit unstable...","1271":"The girl in the picture is mine! You can't have her!","367":"Let's split up...","308":"Sir Cyan! Let their commander have it!","304":"So, it's finally happening...","303":"It's hopeless. We can't keep them out.","353":"To the King, on the double!","365":"Sir Cyan!","1462":"Sir Cyan! We're through.","351":"What lowdown, contemptible...!","347":"Sir Cyan! The Empire's base is bustling with activity. Something must be up!","349":"Sir Cyan!","635":"Ha, ha, ha...","634":"Come, Maria! Follow my lead...","1296":"You can't take Terra away!","1747":"This is our village. You can't just waltz in here and start barking out orders!","1745":"I'll keep Katarin safe.","1743":"I...don't know what to do. Katarin's pregnant...","1749":"A new life... I've got to do my best to help make the world a safer place...","1308":"Katarin... ... I'm sorry. I didn't know how to handle this. I've been an awful husband... But I'm learning. Please, come back with me.","1656":"Cough...wheeze... Don't worry about me! Go! Destroy Kefka!","1655":"Go! Give Kefka the boot!","1650":"Wa, ha, ha... Why the surprised face? Did you think I'd...gone?","1654":"Sabin!! It is now time to complete your training. Use these new skills to smash Kefka!","1653":"Wa, ha, ha... Nothing happened to me! The earth yawned right open to take me but I scrambled to safety!","1648":"Look out! Move! Cough...wheeze... Darn this old body... Hey...you deaf?","1652":"Whoa?! Sabin, this can't be... Tears??","1960":"No, dear! Duncan's still alive and well! He's meditating just north of Narshe.","1399":"I'm sure there's a hidden passage under the rich man's house. Find the room that's drafty.","1422":"I'll never understand Vargas... Fortunately, my husband taught his most secret techniques to you.","558":"Locke! You okay?","531":"Cold as ice......","559":"Something happened to Terra... There seems to be some connection between Espers and her... Anyway, we need to find her. Witnesses saw her screaming across the sky to the west.","277":"Knowing him there's probably some secret switch in this rock wall...","1677":"And then, you opted for your freedom.","561":"Think, people! The Empire still wants that Esper.","1779":"Could that ancient tragedy be playing out once again...","528":"Then we're going up after it!","564":"Let's split up. Those who aren't searching for Terra will stay and guard Narshe. Figaro Castle can shuttle us to the western province. Then we'll make for Kohlingen or Jidoor.","529":"Locke has a complicated past. I wouldn't go thinking he's fallen for you or something!","1678":"It's been...10 years. The little shrimp's grown into a whopping lobster!","1776":"You don't mean...","860":"Agreed... It's hard to trust the Emperor just like that...","1676":"This is for Dad!","553":"Terra......Step away from the Esper......","1675":"If it's heads, you win. We'll choose whichever path we want, without any regrets. Okay?","1674":"Sabin, let's settle this with a toss of a coin.","550":"There's...some kinda reaction!","1680":"Sabin... I often wonder if he'd be proud of me...","546":"That was a close call!","1772":"I had Locke look into the rumor that the Empire is forcing the world's finest scholars to study Espers.","544":"Where's the Esper?","202":"Seemed the Empire had complete control over her.","1673":"What'll happen to this realm if we both leave? And what would Dad say...?","1670":"Matron... Please leave us...","1662":"So... They went and told you...","1868":"The Empire and my realm were allies... until recently.","1782":"We can only fight Magitek enemies with Magitek weapons...","825":"Um......Setzer!!!! I've lost control!!!","197":"You'd...join us? Sabin...!!","1209":"Well, I heard that Figaro had had an accident. I wanted to help, but didn't know where to look. Then I heard that those idiots had escaped from the prison.","225":"You're in danger here. Come with us to Narshe. You'll probably even gain some understanding of your own abilities...","1975":"Where's Sabin when you need him...?","228":"Don't bet on it...... It's probably just hiding from us......","1211":"Bingo. I had to wait until they led me to their secret cave.","230":"Terra! Over here!","233":"No! Sabin!!","1213":"Uh, oh...! Let's hide!","1865":"I'm the King of Figaro. If you cooperate, you'll be well rewarded...","1088":"Watch your mouth! There're ladies present! I was a perfect gentleman.","1086":"I got to know the gal who brought us tea. After a while, she just blurted out the whole crooked plan.","1418":"Look, don't you have a family? Just shut up and take it.","1425":"Stand back! He seems vaguely familiar... Wait a minute...!","241":"Sabin!!!! Take care of yourself!","240":"Seems a little too perky...... Ha...!","237":"Are you sure he's okay, Banon?","235":"He's always been a tad zealous......","590":"We'd best split into 2 groups. We still need to beef up our defenses in Narshe.","223":"We'll escape down the Lete River, and make our way to Narshe. I want to see that Esper for myself...","219":"This's right up your alley! Good luck!","192":"We're on the way to the Sabil mountains.","1093":"Who're you?","1215":"It's completely worthless. Besides, Kefka's the one we need to worry about. Those guys haven't committed any serious crimes...","1091":"We need to rethink our plans. Let's return to the airship.","1684":"Here's to a couple of confused grownups!","1685":"Here's to Dad...","1892":"Somehow we need to tap in to the power of those Espers...","1252":"Right. First things first. For once I feel hopeful!","205":"Banon! She doesn't remember ANYTHING!","1682":"10 years...","1250":"The Falcon's going to give us one last chance at that guy...","1246":"This is THE Falcon?","1981":"If something happens to me, all the world's women will grieve!","585":"Let's talk on the way!","195":"Our time to strike back has arrived. The Empire's going to pay for what it has done...","586":"The Empire's trying to drain magic from Espers...","212":"It's gonna be tough to talk you into helping us... If we push you too hard, we're no different than the Empire... So we want you to make up your own mind.","1206":"What're ya waiting for, Celes? Give me a hand!!","1976":"Ladies first!","1248":"I finally think we're gonna pull this off!","1886":"From here on, it's all up to Terra...","1649":"If only Sabin were here...","170":"Sabin? Is he here?","123":"What are you doing?","121":"What's happening?","120":"...? What the...?!","1348":"It is my dream to build a kingdom in which I can guarantee freedom, and dignity.","154":"Terra, there's someone I'd like you to meet...!","156":"Our mentor, Banon, would certainly like to meet you. \"Magic\" is going to be the key to winning this war.","133":"OK! Dive now!!!","1623":"I got it! A tuxedo, silk hat...and... ...a rose in his teeth!","1106":"How old are you?","157":"Terra has magical powers. That Esper seemed to...react to her. Can there be some connection?","159":"But no HUMAN is born with the powers you seem to have, and...","1625":"What's so great about a bandana? Most of the time I see 'em tied around dogs at the beach!","108":"I'd love to chat with you, but the Chancellor and I must plan our strategy. Sometimes I hate being a king! If you'll excuse me.","107":"Take her to her room...","106":"...Where's Terra?","160":"I apologize.","137":"Dddddddid you just see what I saw...?","1810":"Find Terra!","162":"I'm sure the Empire is going to come after you... If they get their hands on you again, the world's finished... Terra, you want to understand your own powers, right?","1876":"Something horrible's coming!!","150":"Bravo, Figaro!!!","1435":"You know this guy?","1434":"What the...","1392":"The last piece of Magicite!","131":"Or maybe I do!","130":"I guess I have no choice...","142":"Terra......where on earth did you learn that?","200":"Banon! We brought the girl with us.","1368":"Cyan! Think you can handle that switch?!","1365":"The Espers...They no longer exist...","127":"Get ready...!","1426":"That's Shadow...! He'd slit his mama's throat for a nickel!","1337":"And then...","125":"I don't know what you're talking about!","1429":"Hm... What's that smell...?","145":"Me either......it's just that I've never actually SEEN magic before! Where did you...?","1430":"Flowers... His favorite...","784":"So Gestahl must've known the secret of the Espers' power back then.","1940":"We can't be smug. We must be thinking of our strategy.","1431":"And this... His favorite tea...","1108":"You've grown up entirely too fast! Lighten up, okay?!","1432":"These dishes! They were his favorite!","1433":"Sabin...he was...here?!","1784":"I wonder if that's wise...?","102":"You see, there're more girls here than grains of sand out there. I can't keep track of 'em all!","1852":"Go right ahead.","287":"That Esper is either going to save us...or dig us an early grave...","88":"Probably Kefka!","167":"Return to the castle, and tell the others we're safe.","502":"Sabin! You're all right!","1801":"Kefka...grr... What's he up to...?","503":"Who's with you?","519":"The Empire's evil. But not ALL of its citizens are!","84":"Are you blind? Look how thin his face has become!","1412":"That kind of attitude is deadly! He won't even listen!","164":"OK! To the south there's a cave that leads to South Figaro.","863":"Right. And you be careful!","517":"Locke... Are you still thinking about... that?","80":"Guess my technique's getting a bit rusty...","78":"I'll give you 3 reasons First of all, your beauty has captivated me! Second...I'm dying to know if I'm your type...","166":"Through the cave, and eastward to South Figaro.","283":"First, how are your people doing?","279":"I think this's a security check point. If we follow the light exactly, we'll probably be okay. If we make a mistake, the light'll surround us. To proceed safely we must \"tag\" the glimmering light.","1410":"Hold on. I'm King Edgar of Figaro...","87":"Well? How do you like my castle?","1331":"It's time to break into Kefka's domain!","163":"Then I think we need to consult with Banon.","101":"That's a tough one!","139":"She's amazing! That was magic! MAGIC!","1334":"What'll happen?","94":"I thought we were allies! What are you doing in my domain?","73":"I am Edgar, King of Figaro.\u00a0LOCKE\u00a0Surprised someone like me knows a king?","76":"So...you're an Imperial soldier! No problem. Figaro and the Empire are allies! Please, relax while you're here. It's not in my blood to harm a lady.","95":"You've been busy down south! Looking for more cities to destroy?","97":"What brings Kefka, humble servant of Emperor Gestahl, into our lowly presence?","99":"Hmm...this wouldn't have anything to do with this \"witch\" everyone's been whispering about, would it?","141":"Pswswswsw! pswswswsw!!","760":"We've no choice... We must do what we've been avoiding...","494":"I understand all of it... Except... How can WE be encouraging bloodshed?","1512":"This evening is an ill omen...","762":"Here's the plan. We'll cause a tempest that'll sweep all the nasty creatures out of our realm. Then we'll seal the gate... I am the last of our kind able to cast this magical seal.","496":"Something like it.","508":"But...that was only because Doma was collaborating with the Returners! If we make that mistake...","1513":"Everything all right? WHAT? The human's gone?","738":"Did I hear there was a human here?","1815":"I'm troubled...I want to avoid fighting...But...","525":"We really have no choice. Let's make ready for war!","1515":"Where are you going?! D' goh!\u00a0MADUIN\u00a0Madonna's getting drawn into the next world...!","764":"Pass away... but at least we will finally be safe.","1517":"Impossible! It's too late! I've already begun casting the barrier. There's no turning back!","766":"Let's do it. We have no other choice.","501":"People will never learn...","500":"The War of the Magi...","527":"We moved it into the hills.","1965":"You HUMANS freed me from that prison of ice? You possess Magicite?! Who are you?! I sense war and destruction...Could that stupid war possibly have lasted a thousand years? I can tell that you want to put a stop to the madness...Let's see if you are worthy!","700":"You want to help me... But... I haven't long to live. Just as Ifrit did before me, I'll give to you my power...","767":"This is all because of that human girl!","768":"I'm sure she helped the others find us!","746":"I am Maduin. I tired living in the human world... That world is filled with desire, greed and loathing. It's highly infectious...","770":"No! She's one of them! Soon she'll be wearing our hide!","1791":"Ooh...I'm hungry!\u00a0GAU\u00a0Uwao, aooh! I'm Gau! I'm your friend! Let's travel together!\u00a0SABIN\u00a0Not over here...\u00a0SABIN\u00a0Tonic...\u00a0CYAN\u00a0T...this is Sir Gau's treasure?!\u00a0SABIN\u00a0Hey, Gau.

You leave...?","1841":"Magitek Research Facility...? There...your people?","1804":"Gau hit hard!!!","1837":"Why hide fact you Esper?","1878":"Gau! Gau go!!","1836":"Espers...from other world?","1895":"...ooh... Gau...high place... Not good...don't like...","1834":"Terra...she ok?","1812":"Gau...Gau do his best!","1790":"Uwaou!! Waooo......ooo!

People...Esper once live together peacefully...","1986":"Gau become stronger on the Veldt.","468":"Who be Locke? He bad man? Maybe he try steal my treasure!","472":"Here! Here! Shiny thing here!! Sabin, place where you buy food... it called Mobliz! Cyan, place where you stand...... river brought you there...... Now, we go Crescent Mountain! Shiny thing, there!","466":"Does Mr. Thou like shiny thing?","464":"Gau's treasure...... shiny, shiny!! Shiny, shiny, shiny!!!","462":"Ah! I give you present!

We're leaving!!","493":"Me hope so, too...","1201":"Good Job! I used to have a turtle...!","1200":"Now, where were we...?","1204":"You guys get in there while I keep this thing busy!","1190":"Listen, my lady, I've been \"Gerad\" all my life!","1195":"Yeah, You lead the way since it's buried.","1205":"Get going!","1188":"I'll be busy getting ready for our departure to Figaro.","1196":"Let's go help 'em... Hang on a sec... ......? Are you people STILL here?","1192":"What's all the bloomin' fuss about? The words, \"my lady\" are used the world over!","1193":"Oh, yeah, you know how to get into Figaro Castle, don't you?!","1187":"Enough of this nonsense! I have things to do.","1202":"You all right? You were almost a goner.","1198":"Case of mistaken identity, my dear. Give it up!","1185":"What's your problem?","1203":"Here's the problem... What a mess...","1143":"N......noooo!! Why isn't my magic working?!","1142":"Very well. It is only fitting that you go to sleep laughing!","1141":"What's so funny?!","1140":"Now relax......I'm simply going to put you to sleep with the very power you unleashed......","1139":"I don't think so, friend. Your days are now over.","1111":"Come quickly!","1114":"Fuwa, ha, ha! Now THIS is power! This, and my Magicite... now nothing can stop me!","1137":"Kefka! Are you nuts?!","1058":"Leo, I'd like you to take a nice, long snooze...! Very long! Uwa, ha!","781":"We will own this world! Ha, ha, ha...","1125":"Ooh! I've got goose bumps! What power...","843":"Kefka was lying. General Celes realized the war was stupid before anyone else. That's why she joined the returners. Any other questions for me?","780":"Quiet, my dear!!","779":"YOUR girl!? Eh!? Hmmm...Then she's half human and half... How absolutely fascinating! Mwa, ha, ha... She will help us realize our dream faster than we ever imagined!","777":"A...human girl? Wh... Who is she?","1055":"Don't say anything. I understand how you feel.","758":"Aha! We've finally found it! Those ancient writings told us of this world, and described the awesome magical properties of these beasts!","1122":"Well, well...","759":"Grab them! Riches to any man who captures an Esper! GO!","1124":"Fwa, ha, ha... Then you're just in time to perish. Behold! The Statues!!","772":"Shriek!!! Just when we were in reach of a veritable bonanza...!","1127":"Celes... Come to me, my pretty! You and Kefka were given life to serve me!! It is your birthright to rule the world with me!!","1136":"Kefka, stop it! Revive those statues, and you'll destroy the very world we're trying to possess!","1110":"Oh, those silly Espers! To think they opened the gate themselves! The Statues should be just ahead. If we can just get our hands on them, we'll have everything we ever dreamed of!","853":"I'll have my finest warrior accompany us! General Leo!","842":"By the way... With regard to General Celes...","841":"I'm so terribly sorry! Kefka's being severely punished, and we're cleaning up the poison.","840":"I truly apologize about the poisoning of Doma. No one dreamed Kefka would use poison.","839":"Hmm... Well, let's let him stew in his cell for a while. Then we'll decide what to do.","838":"As you know, Kefka's in jail for war crimes. What shall we do with him?","837":"Imagine! All of us here together, sharing a meal! First we must have a toast!","845":"I assure you, I have answered your questions truthfully.","832":"But for now my friends...Let us feast and rejoice!","1534":"We cannot simply ignore the Espers!! Please...come with me!","830":"The power of those Espers... I had no idea...They'll shred the world...! We must get them to understand that we are no longer at war.","846":"My Empire's been decimated by the Espers that emerged from the sealed gate. They're acting spiteful. Unless they're stopped, they'll rip the world asunder!","1533":"I understand. I'm truly sorry for what I've done! Now I must ask for a favor...","856":"We must find the Espers and come to terms with them! You are our last hope!","1532":"I understand. I've ordered this war to be over! Now I must ask for a favor...","1531":"I understand. My only dream in life is...peace! Now I must ask for a favor...","847":"After the Espers went on their rampage, I knew I couldn't go on with my war. I asked myself why I had started it in the first place. By the way... About those questions you asked me... which did you ask first?","848":"Right. Anyway, more than anything I want peace. That's my true dream. I want you to understand that!","850":"Is there anything you wish to hear me say?","1527":"Some of my men refuse to embrace peace. I felt they'd understand if they actually met you face to face.","1526":"I feel we need each other's help at this time...","1525":"My desire for power got the best of me. Now I've come to my senses.","1524":"Well then... To the Returners!","1523":"Well then... To the Empire!","1522":"Well then... To our hometowns!","851":"After they devastated my Empire, the Espers headed northward, toward Crescent Island. They must be found...! We must tell them we're no longer their enemy. After all that I have put them through, it is up to me to set things right. That is why... I need to borrow Terra's power.","852":"We must make for Crescent Island aboard the freighter from Albrook.","826":"I've lost my will to fight...","1144":"K......Kefka!!!!! H......how...?!","1130":"Celes...together we can rule an entire world! Think of it...!","844":"With your permission, I'd like to talk about the Espers...","1148":"No! Kefka!! Don't do something stupid......","43":"With our new-found power, nothing can stand in our way!","42":"It is our destiny, and ours alone, to take this mystic force and claim what is rightfully ours!","1145":"How are you doing this?!","41":"We stand on the brink of a major breakthrough! In the days to come, we'll witness a total revival of magic!","1154":"There'll be no one to worship us...","26":"...... ...... ......","27":"Where am I...?","741":"You're...an Esper? What's that pendant for?","30":"I can't remember a thing...","743":"Esper World... Boy, did I take the low road or what?","745":"You the one who...saved me?","1739":"What an unusual tale...But I sense that you're trying to help make things right again. This should be fun. When do we leave?","1738":"Yes...I have been idle for too long. If I deem you worthy, I'll mime your actions in battle. But first you must tell me what you're doing here.","54":"Now we gotcha!","16":"We won't hand over the Esper!! Whelk! Get them!","248":"This's what happens to traitors!","249":"So, the mighty Celes has fallen!","253":"I'd hate to be in your shoes tomorrow!","15":"We must defend the mines!","251":"Hold your tongue!","9":"Imperial Magitek Armor? Not even Narshe's safe anymore!","14":"We've got 'em trapped, now!","10":"Machine-riding, self-important swine! Take this!","11":"Narshe's freedom depends on us!","1583":"You WHAT?! You b...beat Hidon?! You're lying! LYING!","1600":"What the...!","1597":"What a granddaughter he's raised! Amazing!","1595":"However... Let's let him be! He's nice and...quiet... Now, about my \"wounds\"...","1586":"I don't believe this. This has to be a joke!","1933":"He'll never change. That's who he is! When you were younger you hunted Hidon, the legendary monster. But you quit before you found it...","1564":"Oooh...cough, cough...","1932":"Is that you, Strago? Have you come back to hunt Hidon?","1935":"You never could give me an honest answer.","1936":"What a buffoon!!","1602":"Hidon's appeared at Ebot's Rock again!","1588":"Eh? Oh, they're fine...","1581":"What's all the hullabaloo?!","1562":"It was...Hidon, the beast you and I used to hunt. I almost had it...","1594":"Huh? Finally! He nodded off.","1565":"Strago... Please...you must avenge me...","1601":"Everything okay?","1194":"G'ho ho, do we ever!","697":"Hmmm...\u00a0SHIVA\u00a0Well, Ramuh DID entrust them with his power.","698":"Gestahl has grabbed our friends and is trying to drain them of their power. I, too, suffered my turn in one of the glass tubes...","1471":"This train ferries the dear departed to the \"other side.\" There they can take their eternal rest.","1474":"The Phantom Train guides \"the departed ones\" to the spirit world. They have no need of schedules!","643":"Talk to the man in the room to the far right! He'll help you get up there!","655":"What a reversal! Thinking she's Locke's new queen, Maria is instead nabbed by Setzer! What fate lies in store for her? Stay tuned for Part 2!","639":"But how might he disrupt the opera? ...With that?!","1851":"Is everything okay?","1504":"Wanna stop the train? Just use the controls in the engineer's compartment!","1470":"I manage this train! What business have you here? Hmmm...","616":"Are you mad?!! If something should happen to Maria...","1856":"Your friend left. Said he'd have fallen asleep in another 5 minutes...","652":"Hmm... Might as well make the most of this. MUSIC!!","618":"Come again?","613":"This is simply horrid! I want the performance to be a success! But I don't want Maria to be abducted...!","650":"Aya... What awful acting!","601":"Sorry...my mistake. Wow, you could pass for Maria in a heartbeat! Hoo boy, now I really am in trouble...","1860":"We're all in this together!","1859":"You have 1 more chance.","647":"Disaster! If the two heroes are flattened, the opera's over! Then who'll win the girl?!","607":"Ah! You again!","611":"Dear me, NO! You'll ruin the performance! I'll lose my job!","609":"He'll probably appear right at the climax of Scene 1. He loves an entrance...","1858":"You have 2 more chances.","1857":"Sorry, but yesterday's performance was awful! I'll give you just 3 more chances!","1789":"I'm from Maranda. The Empire invaded, and made me join their army. I fled when I heard we were making for Doma. They caught me...and did this... Now I can't even move. I'll never see Lola again... On the desk is a letter. Will you please read it?","477":"Here's how to build up Gau's skills.","1307":"I'm so happy to have had a child...But Duane seems miserable...","1297":"Duane... Please excuse him. It's just that if Terra goes, she takes with her the very spirit of our survival...","1746":"I feel safe when Duane's around.","1748":"Terra's helped us all to survive. Ever since she's been here, we've felt hopeful for the future.","1750":"We'll be okay. Just make sure these kids'll have a world to grow up in!","1972":"Oh! But it hasn't yet begun! And I'm giving you a front-row seat!","132":"Ackk! Shameful that a king should flee, leaving his people behind! How utterly delightful!","1066":"Now, little Espers... Let's see whatcha got!","129":"Changed your mind...?","126":"Then... welcome to my barbecue!! Uwa ha ha ha!","124":"Bring me the girl. Now!","104":"I truly hope nothing happens to your precious Figaro...!","103":"I'd hate to be you if we find out you're lying... Mwa, ha!","136":"Go!! GET THEM!","100":"Lies! She...merely stole something of minor value. Is she here?","98":"A girl of no importance recently escaped from us. We heard she found refuge here...","93":"Outta my way!","1043":"Hee, hee...! How 'bout a little Magitek mayhem!","151":"Son of a submariner! They'll pay for this...","1045":"G'ha, ha, ha! Emperor's orders! I'm to bring the Magicite remains of these Espers to his excellency! Behold! A Magicite mother lode!!","91":"Ahem...there's SAND on my boots!","1046":"I don't care for the appearance of this pitiful little hamlet...So burn it!!","1048":"Shut up!","1050":"Ah......Leo......always the consummate soldier......","90":"Edgar, you pinhead! Why do you have to live in the middle of nowhere? These recon jobs are the pits!","89":"Phooey! Emperor Gestahl's stupid orders!","1052":"EMPEROR GESTAHL......I need you here......","1056":"Uwee, hee, hee......That's right! What we have to do now is to collect Magicite!","40":"Uwee, hee, hee! Good! Burn up everything!","1059":"So......you think you hit me?! That was simply my shadow! And how did you like my Gestahl? I should've been on the stage! Well, General......","1061":"Oh! A threat...? You're such a violent little brute! I'll tell your \"liege\" I had to exterminate a traitor...!","39":"My sweet little magic user...! Uweee, he, he! With this Slave Crown I'll practically OWN you!!","1062":"Whoa! Yes, I feel some incredible magic power here, today! Wave after wave of pure, magical energy...","1064":"Now for a little Magicite hocus-pocus...!","1065":"First, let's neutralize your abilities.","1067":"Eh?! You wanna take me on? Fine. Here I am...","1063":"I'd say you're all charged up, boys and girls...or whatever...Say, remind me to show you my Magicite collection someday! You might see a few familiar faces!!!","543":"Aack!! I won't forget this!","1069":"Now, my little Magicite pretties......come, and help me build the magical empire of \"Kefka\"!","1358":"I command the greatest power in the universe! You are all helpless before me!","1359":"I will destroy everything... I will create a monument to non-existence!","1360":"No! I will hunt them down. I will destroy it all! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!!","1361":"Hee, hee, hee!! But what fun is destruction if no \"precious\" lives are lost!","1362":"Life... Dreams... Hope... Where'd they come from? And where are they headed...? These things... I am going to destroy!!","1153":"Poor old......Oh well, what a worthless excuse of an Emperor!!","1152":"Run! Run! Or you'll be well done!","1151":"Whoa! More to the right!","1357":"Now, for my next trick, I will make you all...disappear!","729":"Crud! What a mess!!","1150":"You're way off!!!! Where're you aiming?!","1149":"I command you, Statues!!!","1147":"And now, Statues! You've shown me a sign! It is time you show this old man your true power!","1146":"How? Simple! I'm standing within the field of the Statues! Their strong field absorbs all magic sent their way! Or didn't you notice?!","1138":"Nuts...?! Emperor! Don't disturb me! I'm showing them the meaning of power!","1135":"Listen to me, or you'll regret it! Give me...POWER!","1134":"I command you! Give me your power! Arrrgh! Curses!","1133":"Goddesses...you were born only to fight. I implore you...show me your power!!","730":"I don't think so...! You won't get away!","717":"Celes! W...what are you doing? Stop it!!!","1356":"This is sickening... You sound like chapters from a self-help booklet! Prepare yourselves!","715":"Exterminate all of them!","542":"Don't think you won! I'll be back!","541":"Go!! Get those vile insects!","540":"Oho!! It's General Celes, the traitor! How delightful! This'll be fun!","524":"Read my lips!! Dispose of any who oppose us! March!","522":"Exterminate everyone!","520":"I don't care what you do here, JUST GET ME THAT ESPER!!","1339":"I've tapped into the ultimate power. Observe...!","1340":"Such magnificent power! You are like insects to me!","1341":"I will exterminate everyone, and everything!","1342":"Then I'll destroy those too. Why do people rebuild things they know are going to be destroyed? Why do people cling to life when they know they can't live forever? Think how meaningless each of your lives is!","1343":"And have you found your \"joy\", in this nearly dead world of ours?","1160":"You can't escape me!!","694":"I'm all-powerful! Hee, hee, haw! I'm collecting Espers! I'm extracting magic! And... ... ... I'll restore the...Statues!","695":"You've been completely drained of your powers! Now you're useless to me!","696":"And you! Take a hike!","1157":"Who're you?!","708":"So that's it! Magicite... Cid, you miserable blockhead! Now...","709":"General Celes!! The game's over. Bring me those Magicite shards!","712":"G'hee, hee, hee! She has tricked you all! Celes, that's so...YOU!","1068":"Imagine! Thinking you could defeat ME!! This is rich! Mwa, ha, ha!","1132":"You...vicious brat! Grrr... Aargh... I hate hate hate hate hate hate...hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate HATE YOU! Grrr...","803":"Now I fear you've outlived your usefulness......","337":"He's no longer here! I'm in charge now. Pour it!","331":"You loser! I'll take care of this situation in no time!","333":"We need not spare those lands that gave rise to the Returners!","334":"You just go and be a good little boy...!","296":"Hey, you! You keeping a sharp lookout?","335":"Is the poison ready?","1519":"Grrr! How DARE they put me in a place like this!","801":"U'hee, hee, heeee!!!! The Emperor was right! Let Terra fall into your hands, and you'd open the gate for us...!","339":"Do it! Take 'em all out!","340":"Unh? Silence! You're history, bub...","802":"How does it feel to know you've been working for us?!","804":"Oh dear...... you wanna fight me?! This is just dreadful!","342":"\"Wait,\" he says...... Do I look like a waiter?","1520":"I don't believe this!","343":"Ha, ha, ha! ...What a toad!","344":"Huh!? How long do you expect me to put up with you? Next time, you're a goner.","806":"It opened!!","345":"Oh, gripe! Hey! If you know what's good for you...","346":"Hee, hee! Nothing can beat the music of hundreds of voices screaming in unison! Uwa, ha, ha!","807":"I, I, I, I feel so anxious.","808":"Frightful energy!!","1521":"What a bore.","1128":"Kill the others and we'll overlook your treachery!","1073":"I don\u2019t believe this!","1072":"Phew... I think I have plenty of Magicite for the time being... that is, until I make my way through your precious sealed gate!!","1129":"Take this sword! Take care of them. Immediately!!","1071":"This is ridiculous! I had no idea you were such wimps! Time to put a stop to all of this.","1070":"G'haw, haw...... Ooh! They're warm to the touch! What treasures!","329":"Now that Leo's gone, I'll turn this water into a flowing river of poison!","298":"Please! Save your petty small talk! Just do your job!","362":"I fear for your family. Uhh...chest is on f...fire...","364":"Go...run to your family...hack... gasp... ......","356":"Who's there?","358":"Indeed! My sight is going fast... Can't see a thing...","360":"Cyan... You have defended the realm since my father's days...hack, cough... Thank you... It's over... Our kingdom is through.","1057":"ut my liege......what have I been fighting for...?","1054":"ut, Emperor...!","1053":"y liege!","1051":"here are you, Kefka......Show yourself!!","1049":"Kefka! Your behavior is dishonorable! I can't allow this!","1047":"Kefka! No!","1044":"Kefka! What ARE you doing?!","1033":"Locke...you're back! And you've made the Espers understand our desire for peace!","1034":"I am General Leo. May I have your name, please?","1060":"hut up, Kefka! I oughtta......","1037":"Speak no further. It is we who owe you an apology. We hungered for your power\u2026How close we came to reenacting the War of the Magi!!!","855":"I'll be waiting for you in Albrook.","874":"Looks like you're feeling better...","880":"Of course!","878":"I knew you were being used as a kind of biological weapon...And because I didn't do anything about it, I'm no different than Kefka...","876":"People are people. Not all of us are like Kefka.","1924":"Terra, we'll continue yesterday's conversation later...","1930":"No. I won't let this happen!","873":"You all right?","872":"We should arrive tomorrow morning. Why not rest until then?","870":"Right...let's go.","867":"Our departure isn't till tomorrow. I've arranged some lodging for you. Please, get some rest.","866":"Is something wrong?","865":"Let me introduce... General Celes...and Shadow.","864":"There you are. Another of the Empire's generals, and a person I hired in town will be traveling with us.","854":"I'm General Leo. Nice to meet you.","1907":"You! You're Cyan, liege to the king of Doma! Please forgive me for not being there to stop Kefka...","313":"So, that's their strategy.","882":"You're just young. ...but I understand what you mean. I understand only too well...","317":"You're from Maranda, right?","895":"We're almost at Crescent Island. When we disembark, we'll split into two groups. Celes and I will form one group. Terra, you go with Locke and Shadow. If you spot the Espers, report at once!","315":"Patience! If we attack now, we'll have to sacrifice too many lives.","330":"The Emperor has ordered me to return home. I don't want any trouble here!","327":"Okay... Just don't jump the gun.Please...","325":"Right. I'll leave Doma in your hands.","323":"The Emperor summons me. I must return immediately.","332":"Don't be pompous! And DON'T forget that they are PEOPLE, just like you and me.","319":"And your family lives there? Fall in battle, and I'll have to deliver the bad news... What shall I say to them? You have a life to go back to someday. Don't throw it all away for nothing. Emperor Gestahl wouldn't want that.","593":"Don't worry, I'll go with her.","1314":"You're all safe! Behold...A legendary relic that can restore life...","509":"That's nonsense!!","510":"The Empire's poised to attack Narshe right now!","614":"We'll let him grab her...","512":"Celes, here, was one of the Empire's generals...","610":"Right! If we could only grab him then...!","515":"WAIT! Celes has joined the Returners! She's fighting with us, now!","1773":"All the trouble in Narshe is over an Esper, too...","516":"I promised I'd protect her. I WILL NOT back out on my word.","608":"I read that letter. Setzer's coming to steal her...","545":"Is it okay?","606":"Let's set up a meeting...with Setzer...","603":"Who's this \"Wandering...\"? what's-his-name?","548":"Terra!! What is it!?","555":"... Where's Terra?!","560":"Let's go! I promised her I'd...","599":"Well... There're bound to be treasures there. And besides, I've always wanted an inside look at the Empire!","597":"The people of Jidoor, a town to the south, can probably help us.","595":"Please wait for us in Narshe. We'll find our way back safely.","615":"We'll use Celes as a decoy. After she's abducted, I'll follow 'em right to his airship!","1778":"My Grandma used to tell me stories about magical machines... Could they have been true?","938":"Count me in. You'd better stay out here, gramps.","619":"You said SHE looks like Maria, right?","785":"And those Espers at the facility were grabbed during that expedition! That means Celes's power came...... at the expense of an Esper...","735":"I'll explain on the way... ...about Terra...Espers...the Returners...","733":"I'm worried about Terra. Let's return to Zozo.","731":"Let's not overstay our visit. We're outta here on the double!","714":"I... ... ...","710":"Celes! You...deceived me?!","707":"!? Celes...?","689":"This ship's going to stick out like a sore thumb. Better land some distance away.","687":"This unwieldy-looking ship really moves! Could it crash?","681":"Listen to yourself! Celes...you can't become his wife! You just can't!","676":"WHAT! Are you stupid!?","671":"The Empire's also totally rotten! It's using magic to enslave the world.","666":"And that you were the world's most notorious gambler...","660":"... Where's Setzer?","617":"That's why the decoy! We'll hide Maria somewhere safe!","659":"But this is the tough one! Part 2 begins now!","649":"I, Locke, the world's premier adventurer, will save her!","648":"Neither Draco nor Ralse will save Celes!","644":"It's as good as done!","642":"We haven't a second to lose!","638":"Uh oh...Better tell the Impresario!","637":"Well done, Celes.","633":"You'd better check the score one last time.","631":"That ribbon suits you.","629":"I...once abandoned someone when she needed me...","627":"Aye yai yai! Izzat...you!?","625":"Let's get ready! Celes, it's show time!","623":"Not bad, Celes!","621":"Celes will be our Maria! She'll lead us to the airship!","1315":"Correct! Legend has it that ages ago the Phoenix was turned to stone...And many legends are based on facts...This has some major cracks in it though...I fear it may have lost its power over time...","657":"What a performance!","1317":"I wasn't able to save Rachel...I've lost all sense of purpose...My life will have no meaning until I can right this terrible wrong...","1398":"Ouch!! I gotta steal me some new clothes, fast!!","1327":"Right, let's move out! We have an appointment with Kefka!","75":"Talk to you later!","105":"I'd say that guy's missing a few buttons...\u00a0EDGAR\u00a0...Where's Terra?","109":"Follow me.","110":"Don't you worry 'bout a thing! I'll...","1626":"HEY! What do you mean by that?","112":"That's TREASURE HUNTER!","74":"Surprised someone like me knows a king?","1624":"I think that's overdoing it just a bit... He should have a bandana on his head!","114":"The old man you met in Narshe is one of us.","116":"That's not true! They were using you! Things are different now.","118":"I can't tell you what to do. You don't have to decide right now. You'll soon find your way...","138":"Yeah......this kid seems loaded for bear......","140":"M M M M M M M MAGIC?! She used magic?","144":"Look, I didn't mean to make such a big deal of this......","113":"On the surface, Edgar pretends to support the Empire. The truth is, he's collaborating with the Returners, an organization opposed to the Empire. I am his contact with that group...","146":"Edgar, Terra can use magic, and we can't. That's the only difference between us. The fact is......we could use her help!","69":"This is the pits. We'd better hightail it southward, to Figaro.","67":"Give it time. You're safe with me! I give you my word!","1979":"As long as there're people who need to be protected, I'll fight!","45":"I PREFER the term treasure hunting!","47":"There's a HUGE difference!","48":"Anyway, were you the one who sent for me?","50":"......!? This better not have anything to do with that Magitek-riding, imperial...witch!!!","52":"All right... I think we'd better help her...","68":"I won't leave you until your memory returns!! By the way, this secret entrance might be useful some day. Don't forget about it!","55":"Wonderful... There's a whole bunch of 'em...","58":"Couldn't hold out...?! Uh oh...","59":"Thanks, Moogles! We're in your debt!","60":"I think this switch'll...","61":"Eh? You back with us now?!","63":"Save your thanks for the Moogles!","65":"You have amnesia?!","56":"Moogles...! Are you saying you want to help me?","152":"This is great!","1938":"I can't believe we played a major role in it all!","155":"We're members of the Returners.","267":"But what's it matter, anyway? I just want to, okay?!","268":"What IS that noise?","271":"Come again?!","273":"Are you sure you'll be okay?!","275":"Whew!!! Looks like we're in the clear!","1427":"Better steer clear of him, I guess.","266":"You remind me of someone...","1424":"At the very least you could give me a response...","1405":"Oops! Forgot I was wearing these clothes.","1403":"Oh, I forgot I was wearing a uniform!","788":"Hmm... Maybe we should head back that way.","1397":"These are a little too big, but they'll do.","1380":"I will not let go...  ...I promise!","1345":"And I have learned to celebrate life...and the living.","1416":"Edgar, What's the matter? You look positively spooked!","262":"Let's go!","261":"Trust me! You'll be fine!","260":"I'll protect you!","169":"Who're YOU?","171":"You were shadowing us earlier, right?","188":"The brothers are reunited!","199":"Let's get going!","209":"Someone important to me was jailed by the Empire. I've hated the Empire ever since... I joined the Returners when I realized the Empire was rotten to the core. I wanted to make a difference.","211":"That's not entirely true. Besides, I'm sure there are people who feel YOU'RE important to them! They are counting on you...","218":"I know... \"Someone\" has to sneak into South Figaro and slow the Empire down, right?","220":"Terra... Please wait for me... And...please... ...don't let a lecherous young king, who shall remain nameless, near you!","242":"Nuts! Gotta get to Narshe on the fly...","244":"Hey! Call me a treasure hunter, or I'll rip your lungs out!","245":"Here we go!","246":"These are a little tight, but the price was right.","247":"I've seen her before... Of course! She's one of the Empire's generals!","254":"I'm with the Returners. Name's Locke.","256":"Let's go!","1326":"The treasures of the Phoenix Cave!","1094":"He's one of this town's citizens.","1324":"Thanks, I'm okay...I feel lighter than air...From here on...I'll be all right. Let's go! We have work to do!!","1861":"Don't make any more mistakes!","1078":"This'll have to do...","975":"Say, old man, what else can you tell us about these goddesses?","1831":"What if there were some way to...call her back?","974":"Some faint letters are carved on the back of the stone figures...","819":"Setzer, get down!","857":"If Terra goes, I'll go.","859":"The rest of you wait here. I smell a rat...","1830":"You mean those herbs have actually saved her?","862":"Please do. Leave no stone unturned!","868":"Come on...! Why won't you speak to me?","1081":"Now I'm worried about Edgar and the others...","1828":"Wait a minute! She said \"Yes!\" We were gonna...","982":"Say, old timer, what happened to the stone goddesses?","869":"Even if it was only a little...I doubted you... But I'm still your friend...","985":"Phew...what a story.","900":"But you've heard it before?","1016":"Gramps, take Relm and clear outta here!","815":"What's that?","1850":"I'm going to the dressing room.","1884":"Beyond is the Esper World...","1822":"Soon, you'll...","990":"Hey, squidball! Don't you ever learn?","1823":"You're not going to believe what awaits us up here! Come on, it's worth a fortune!","816":"It can't be......! An Esper???","1085":"Way to go, Edgar!","817":"It's coming!!! Watch out, Terra!!","987":"I think it's worth a look.","1825":"Rachel! Are you awake?","1029":"The past is history. The Empire seems to want to talk peace with you. Why not come with us?","896":"Let's go.","1089":"General Leo's gone...Kefka did him in...","1807":"I promised Terra I'd...keep her safe...","898":"Come on.","894":"I think I'm gonna...","892":"I think I'm gonna...","1799":"Bloody Empire!! We are your worst enemy!","919":"Thanks for your time!","968":"I think it's worth a look.","1039":"I believe our job is finally over! I, for one, could use some peace and quiet...","1005":"Don't be so heartless!","893":"Not a word of this to anyone else, o shrouded one...","963":"But...where do we start looking?","917":"I see... There's something wrong here...","823":"They seemed......angry.","890":"Urgh... Uooh... Argh...","1890":"I'm sure the Espers were headed for Vector...","965":"Why there?","891":"Ooh... Ohhhhhhh...","1004":"Ask her to draw your portrait. She may actually make you look pleasant!","950":"Can everyone here use magic? What's going on here?","811":"What's wrong, Terra?","970":"Going somewhere?","929":"What're you doing?","1077":"We not only lost Leo, but Shadow, too... Curse the Empire!","820":"Where are they going?","1031":"Let's go to Thamasa and talk with General Leo.","940":"Try to avoid the flames.","1838":"But my grandma told me that Espers and people once lived side by side! Was that just a fairy tale?","953":"But I thought they perished centuries ago...","977":"So, they're the goddesses of magic, then?","1019":"I wonder if she's gonna go ballistic again?!","1820":"...wasn't able to... save her when she needed me...","1032":"General Leo.","813":"What do you mean you can feel it?","996":"Relm and Ultros......What ARE you doing......?","1258":"Could you please attach this reply to a carrier pigeon?","1754":"I hope his reply comes soon!","1755":"I knew that these flowers and letters weren't sent by my boyfriend. I just didn't want to admit it. I was lying to myself... But I'm all right now. As I read those letters......the pain I felt in my heart became bearable...I'm sure whoever wrote them has suffered greatly...I wish I could meet him...","1257":"Look! My boyfriend in Mobliz sent me all these flowers! They're all hand-made of silk. And these are letters he has written to me...","1259":"Thank you.","1929":"General Leo, prepare yourself!","778":"Please... take care...of my baby...","1514":"Terra's all right.","775":"Thank you...","748":"So...I'm an example of the evil in this world, huh?","773":"Maduin... I'm not their friend...","750":"I'll return to my world tomorrow!","765":"I, for one, will not miss the other side...","754":"But humans and Espers can never coexist...!","757":"It's Terra. Not bad, huh?","776":"Can you make it back here?","774":"I understand that!","769":"Get a grip on yourself!","763":"But in your state, you might just...","761":"You mean... the magic barrier?","1516":"Madonna's getting drawn into the next world...!","756":"We've given her a name...","755":"How do we know for sure unless we observe for ourselves? How do we know... unless we... observe for ourselves...?","753":"If you don't want to return to your world, you may stay here.","751":"You'll need a guide.","749":"No, I mean...","747":"Are humans and Espers truly...so different?","744":"The Esper folk are pretty upset, you being a human and all...","742":"It's...yours now! It helps protect the Esper World.","740":"Did I awaken you?","739":"Probably... ...wandered in here by mistake.","737":"Listen well, and think clearly! What will you do?","1381":"Terra...we must part now. We Espers will disappear from this world...forever. But if the human part of you is very strongly attached to something or someone...You will probably be able to remain in this world as a human being...","1518":"That fool...","72":"How rude of me to turn my back to a lady!","1449":"The Empire has set up a base somewhere beyond the forest, and to the east.","70":"You mean, THIS young woman...?!","1450":"They seem to have their sights set on Doma Castle.","693":"Urghh... Gonna toss it all...","1452":"Your only chance is through Doma. I'll show you the way. Just know that I may take off at any time, if I feel like it.","1499":"I am Ziegfried, the world's greatest swordsman! That treasure chest is mine. If I were you, Ox, I'd grab grandpa, here, and run!","691":"I...I'm gonna be sick!","1436":"Of course. He left a couple of days ago after he heard Master Duncan was slain. He headed into the mountains. I heard Duncan's son, Vargas, is missing as well. I have a bad feeling about this...","602":"He's the director of the operas here. Everyone just calls him [Impresario.] He's been in a tizzy ever since that letter arrived.","604":"You born on a farm, son?","82":"Edgar has a twin brother. He was such a nice boy...","1414":"Edgar's at it again!? He hits on anything that moves!","1508":"Sabin... Every bit an adult, now... I remember that time so vividly. I was so angry\u2026 I learned something important on that day...","86":"Yes... His name is Sabin. Oh, he looked so like his father! When he ran away, he was a sweet little child. I wonder what he's like now?","1663":"Edgar! Here you are...","1667":"That's not...","1664":"Your father... He just uttered his last wish that Figaro be divided between you...","1969":"It's only been a year since the world changed...But it feels like forever.","932":"All right. We really have no choice.","1925":"Welcome, welcome! Magic...? What is this \"magic\"?","935":"I think that's because they keep so many Fire Rods in here...","930":"Magic is forbidden!","1931":"I can only take some comfort in the fact that there were so few casualties.","933":"Stand back.","1926":"No one is to divulge that we are able to use magic!","1417":"I can't take money from the King!","1445":"Welcome! Need anything?","1401":"Thanks to the Empire, my business is up!","1444":"Howdy. I own the dry goods business out here! You're...not from these parts, huh? We'll, no matter!","1447":"Good day. Need anything?","243":"You're that thief, Locke, aren't you?","1419":"Sir Sabin, I can't take your money!","1446":"See you around.","1400":"Look! As luck would have it, I'm fresh out of merchandise!","1330":"Say, we could use some sasquatch muscle!! Besides, he'd be helpless here without me! He's somewhere in the mines. Once we find him, I'll order him to join us!","1740":"I'm your boss, kupo! You're gonna join us, kupo!!!","1329":"Kupoppo! You're alive! I thought you were all feeding the worms, kupo! Kupohoho! Let's go!","1373":"Heeeeelp! Save me!","1354":"I have my friends here!","1741":"Umaro! No slouching, now!","1374":"The hair!! Watch the hair!!!","57":"Use us to save Terra from the guards! Need more information?","1714":"XXXX GP!","1923":"Stay clear of the engine room. It's dangerous.","1711":"Ho, ho, ho... There's nothing I can't buy!","1795":"There used to be ships sailing to the southern continent. Tzen, Albrook, Maranda... They've all been smashed.\u00a0NPC\u00a0Ya met that odd man, lives near the Lete River? His wife bore 'im a son 13 years ago. It was a problem birth, and the woman passed away. The man totally lost it. He thought the newborn was a monster. Wonder what happened to the poor little baby?\u00a0DANCER\u00a0Yoo hoo! You handsome thing. How 'bout joining me? Tee hee!\u00a0CYAN\u00a0H...how dare you... you licentious howler!\u00a0DANCER\u00a0Geez, don't blow an artery, baby!\u00a0CYAN\u00a0B...baby?!\u00a0SABIN\u00a0Cyan... Don't let it get to you.","1709":"Hey...HEY! Stay with me now!\u00a0CLYDE\u00a0Where...am...?","1710":"Arrrgh! I HATE it when that happens!","1904":"We didn't have to do a thing! The Empire's troops just ran away in terror!","1905":"What's going on?","1880":"Our battle lies before us. We must make ourselves ready.","37":"Over here!","38":"Make your way out through the mines! I'll keep these brutes occupied!","44":"Took you long enough! How goes the robbing and plundering trade?","46":"Ha! Semantic nonsense!","49":"Yeah. There's a girl I'd like you to meet.","32":"Impressive! I've never heard of anyone recovering this fast...!","51":"Imperial troops are pursuing her even as we speak. This town is no match for the Empire. Our independence can only be assured if we join forces with the Returners, an underground resistance movement. That girl wasn't responsible for her actions. We must get her to understand our dilemma!","29":"Easy! This is a Slave Crown. The others had complete control over you while you were wearing it.","53":"Agreed. Make your way first to Figaro, and talk to the king.","28":"Whoa! And I only just removed the crown!","31":"Don't worry. It'll all come back to you...in time, that is.","36":"Look, I have to get you out of here! I don't have time to explain!","1273":"Thanks for saving the day! This picture's more precious to me than my own life!","1269":"Relm! We can't attack this masterpiece! It would be inexcusable!","1275":"It all started when I bought a stone at the Auction House. I took one look at it and suddenly felt I needed a portrait of Starlet. I asked several artists, but none could muster enough skill. It was then that I heard about Relm's amazing ability. I brought her here, and put her to work. But while she was painting, that thing came along... It must have been enticed here by that stone.","1268":"Yes... And now it's nearly impossible to get it to show itself...","1267":"It's...there's a monster hiding in my prized painting of a goddess...","1266":"P...please... Help that painting!!","1276":"The stone? Over on that bookshelf.","1279":"I'll be waiting for you!","1277":"Phew. I don't need any more bad luck. Just take it and go!","1723":"Well, we have our treat for the day. Let's go home!","1722":"1000000 GP!","1716":"No, you don't! Now, pipe down!","1719":"Ho, ho, ho...All right! But just this once! And... ... Keep it a secret from Mama!","1721":"500000 GP!","1303":"\"But Terra...!\"","1214":"\"You don't want that treasure back...?\"\u00a0EDGAR\u00a0It's completely worthless. Besides, Kefka's the one we need to worry about. Those guys haven't committed any serious crimes...","1289":"\"Why not come with us?\"\u00a0SHADOW\u00a0Well...","1319":"Uwaaaaaa! The Magicite's gonna shatter!","1318":"If only the Magicite didn't bear those deep cracks...I think you've been wasting your time, young man!","423":"So! You've been slowing my progress!","424":"I will let you go... <D>...but first there is something I must do...","1328":"Eh!? What're you doing here? Doesn't matter, really... nothing left anyway...There's only one Moogle still around, and only a treasure hunter could pick that lock...","1826":"... ......? I... I can't remember anything...","1320":"Locke...I've dreamed of seeing you.I wanted to hear your voice.","1321":"The Phoenix has given me so little time...I have to leave again soon...But I have something I must tell you...","1829":"Go! I don't know who you are, but ever since you came here my parents have been upset!","1824":"Locke! Look out!","1322":"Locke... ... With you I was so happy...In the instant that the accident occurred, I thought only of you...And about the joy you brought me. Thank you, Locke...I'll never forget you...","1323":"I have to go now... ...I'll always love you...You must now cast off the anguish you've been harboring inside for so long... Today I set your heart free. You must learn to love yourself again, and regain your self respect....... Phoenix! Be reborn again!! And give your power...to Locke!!","1821":"Locke! What are we off to find today?","1827":"Get outta here! It's your fault she's lost her memory!","584":"These are my comrades who fell while escaping the Empire. And I will give you my power, as well...","1848":"We few can help save many. The War of the Magi must not be repeated...","583":"That's what's left of us when we...pass away.","582":"When we transform into Magicite, our power can be relocated.","581":"Gestahl's methods are incorrect. You can't drain a live Esper of all its power. It is only when we are reduced to Magicite that our abilities can be transferred in total...","580":"Like a coward, I escaped leaving the others there. It'll be the end of them...","579":"Then free those of my kind imprisoned in Gestahl's Magitek Research Facility. One of them can surely help her.","578":"When she accepts this aspect of herself, I think she'll be all right.","576":"No, she's actually quite different.","567":"You call her Terra... ...Terra?? How odd...","568":"She is undamaged. But I fear she can't understand you. As for me, I am Ramuh. The Esper, Ramuh.","566":"This girl is your friend?","569":"That doesn't mean we don't live here, too. Espers take a variety of forms. Sometimes we live here, taking the shape of humans. You have nothing to fear from us.","565":"She's scared, you know.","577":"Her very existence strikes fear into her own heart.","571":"No, that was no fairy tale. That was true. We started out as friends. Then along came the War of the Magi...","570":"Humans and Espers can't survive together.","572":"It took place...long ago. Espers fought humans who were infused with magical power extracted from Espers... Fearing our magical powers would once again become a target, we fashioned a new realm, and moved there.","573":"Even as we speak, many of my kind are trapped in the Empire's Magitek Research Facility, being... ...drained of their powers... I fled here to avoid a similar fate.","574":"That's right, relax.","575":"I sensed that Terra was in trouble. My magic...summoned her here.","1353":"And I have a brave Grandpa who'll stand by me through it all.","1557":"Yea!! We're back! It's like old times!","1080":"I\u2019ll go with you.","1017":"What is it?","1559":"This is terrible! Gungho's hurt!","948":"Thank you...","905":"What a cute doggy!","999":"Forget it! I don't wanna draw it anymore!","946":"Yes. Thanks, Grandpa!","1984":"Let's do it! Let's go get that madman!","1097":"I'm coming along, too.","1099":"What? Who is this puffed up aerobics instructor, anyway?","1101":"Aaack! I'm gonna paint your portrait!","1103":"That's better!","1007":"Hee, hee, hee... You're gonna love it!","910":"Well...all right...","1009":"Hey! Did you see me? I was awesome! Wouldn't I be more helpful than Gramps?","908":"I will not! What a fussy old man!","1382":"Grandpa! Stop goofing around!!","1105":"What's wrong, lover boy?","1012":"That's better!","1000":"It's okay......I'll just jump down from here.","1013":"Are these...Espers?!","997":"Listen, Ulty...... Why don't you pose for me?","994":"I couldn't miss the chance to practice my drawing!","992":"Grandpa! I'm here......!","1386":"... ...but you know... Just once I'd really like to do a portrait of you...on canvas, of course!","1752":"I'm still a bit groggy...But I'm okay. Interceptor always makes me happy!","1384":"If I hear even a peep out of you, I'm gonna draw your portrait!","1107":"I'm coming along, too.","1928":"Interceptor, please come back again and play!","1272":"Hey! Relax! The monster croaked!","1282":"Idiot! Of course I'm all right!","1584":"No, he's not! He really defeated Hidon.","1729":"I won't be done in by an older woman!","1571":"But Grandpa! This \"obsession\" of yours could easily slay you! You're my Grandfather. I can't just sit idly by and watch you go.","1730":"Wait a minute, lover boy!","1569":"Just a minute! You don't think you're going alone, do you?","1943":"I know. Let me draw their portraits!","1280":"You!! You old fool!!! You're still standing?!","922":"Oh, all right...","1284":"Did you think I was gonna check out before you, old man?! <D>Ah, ha, ha...","1286":"Come along now...We're all glad to see you!","960":"Me too!","1278":"I have to go! But fear not, I'll be back to finish this painting!","903":"Grandpa. Who are these people? Friends? Can they use magic, too?","1731":"You can't just throw me aside!","1593":"What happened to Grandpa?","1042":"I'm too hot, Grandpa.","1599":"Only Strago could have been taken in by that performance!","1598":"And what a terrible actor you are!","1732":"How about a nice portrait for you, hmm?!","1566":"Gramps! Why are you hesitating!","1274":"Huh?! What are you talking about?","1596":"Wait! First let me thank you. You gave Grandpa a reason to go and defeat something that had tormented him for decades! Even if YOU were faking, that creature meant business!","962":"What a fuddy duddy...","911":"What a sweet puppy!","1903":"The war... It's over...right?","1900":"What on earth...","1494":"Well! I've stuffed down all I can... Let's go!","1957":"I...I...I'm losing my grip...Keep up the fight, brother!","1492":"Worried? Can't wage war on an empty stomach!","1500":"You look more like a manicurist. Now SCRAM!!!","1507":"Thanks for your help! Let's join ranks again some time!","1941":"Let me at the Empire!","1495":"Food! Chop! Let's go slop the hogs!","1490":"Food! Food! Bring me everything ya got!","1480":"Cyan... You're not...scared, are you!?","1486":"But... The greater our number, the slower we can move. Forget it!","1451":"Doma, huh? I have to reach Narshe immediately!","1612":"Just a minute... We can't just go there with you looking like this. I know! Let's go to Jidoor and give you a make-over!","1611":"Right!! Let's go tell your father the news! He needs to know you're his son!","1609":"Yes. This is definitely your father.","1608":"Come on, Gau. It's true, right?","1607":"You don't suppose...Gau, could this be your father?","1962":"There's only one little problem, eh, brother!","1455":"So Doma's next, huh? I have to reach Narshe immediately!","1458":"What the...? Where'd these soldiers come from?","1606":"You don't suppose... Can this be Gau's father?","1464":"That guy's a sitting duck! Gotta help him, fast!","1465":"Uwaaa! It's that poison! This isn't gonna be easy...","1961":"Don't treat us like strangers anymore!","1466":"Nothing but poison this way!","1604":"That's why we...","1468":"Ouuuch! ...didn't MEAN to step in there...","1866":"My brother's the King of Figaro. Cooperate, and you'll be well rewarded!","1473":"Hmmm... They're all blank!","1475":"What's this? Let me just give it a...","1477":"Gave it my best shot.","1620":"This is it!","1482":"Cyan... You're a total klutz when it comes to machines.","1484":"What is it?","1621":"Perfect! Functional yet sporty! Done!","1627":"Okay, Gau? Now, any father'd be glad to have a son like you!","1634":"But, Sir...","1630":"Sir...You...had a son, right? You with me!","1668":"You were as bad as any of 'em!","1666":"No one cared when Mom passed away, either...","198":"I think Duncan would rest easier if he knew his disciple played a part in bringing peace to the world.","196":"Think a \"bear\" like me could help you in your fight?","194":"I've been watching from afar, hoping that the world might regain some sanity... At this rate, Figaro will be reduced to a puppet state.","193":"To the Returner hideout, no doubt?","191":"Anyway, brother, what are you doing here?","190":"I'll...take that as a compliment...","1665":"This is NONSENSE!! Everyone's saying that the Empire poisoned Dad... And the only thing on your minds is \"Who's going to be the next king?!\" You're all pathetic!","1661":"B...brother... Waa, ahhh, ahhh...","1660":"And yet it's all different... Mom and Dad are gone... Everyone's gone... Since that day...","1659":"Hmm... Castle hasn't changed much...","187":"Big brother?","1658":"Hey! Wait. I'm going too!","185":"f only you hadn't been in such a rush for power......","1657":"This's like old times! I have to wander around for a while!","1614":"Don't say \"Yaoooo\" when you mean \"Yes!\"","182":" guess there's no avoiding this!","178":"Our Master wanted you to be his successor, not me. He appreciated your fine spirit......","1669":"Empire of murderers... They won't get away with this!","213":"The only thing I can add is that you can trust my brother implicitly. He's always been fair with me. You can trust him, Terra... But don't you DARE tell him I said that!","176":"No! You were the one he chose!","1956":"Hey! You're alive!!! Get in there, quick!","1631":"Right. The truth is, he's alive! Come here, Gau!","1686":"...to Mom... ...and to Figaro.","1651":"Duncan... I'm so glad you're safe!!!","1683":"Where has the time gone...?","1681":"Don't you ever doubt that!","1636":"I'm trying to tell you...","149":"The Master's teachings...... Must use a Blitz technique......","1679":"And you're a king crab!","1639":"Why! You old... He's completely lost his mind! Gau, I'm gonna clobber him!!","1628":"Excuse me, Sir.","1640":"I...I'm sorry...","1954":"Hey! Celes!","1672":"You said you were sick of it too, right?!","239":"What the...?","234":"Don't distract me, brother!!","232":"Watch out! I'm going to hit it with a Blitz!","227":"I guess we thrashed it.","221":"Big brother... Aren't you EVER going to grow up?","1671":"I'm outta here! I'm forsaking this war-sick realm for my dignity and freedom.","174":"Vargas, why'd you do it? How could you do your own father in like that?!","1869":"The Empire'll end up owning you!","1613":"No, Gau! Don't eat with your fingers!","397":"Then let's just bust through!","398":"Can't believe we've made it this far... Say, how do we get to Narshe from here?","431":"This must be Baren Falls.","429":"Cyan! Is that your wife and child?","427":"We shouldn't be here. Let's go NOW!","426":"Hoo, boy! Finally got off...","422":"Okay... The time has come to see if all my training has paid off. Come, Cyan!","421":"I know!\u00a0CYAN\u00a0You have an idea?","1802":"Master Duncan's techniques mustn't fail me.","419":"I have things to do HERE. We have to stop this thing. Let's make for the engine.","417":"Wait a sec... I don't want to go THERE!","415":"What's with this train?","1376":"I didn't turn my back on the kingdom, big brother... I knew you'd be a better king. I trained hard knowing I might have to help you one day... Now I know why I have these stupid muscles!","433":"And the Empire's right on our tails.","549":"Terra 'n the Esper...","411":"I...it's moving!","562":"Banon needs our help, too...","409":"What on earth...?","407":"Don't worry!","405":"We can't just wander around out here! We have to go on board!","403":"Hey! We can get in right here!","402":"May be survivors inside. Let's take a look.","400":"All right! It's decided. Let's get going!","1811":"I'll watch over Narshe! Go quickly!","486":"Let's go!","1893":"Let's see what's become of the Empire! Hurry!","413":"Won't open!","435":"What the......","439":"No more for you.","441":"You're a regular munchkin!","487":"No kidding.","1448":"You...on a journey? I got separated from my friends. Say, can you tell me how to get to Narshe?","488":"But unless we hop in, we won't see our friends again...","489":"Let's go!","485":"Will this really let us breathe underwater?","491":"I hope the others arrived safely!","484":"Hummm... Is this of any use?","483":"Looks like it just might fit...","480":"Shall we look around?\u00a0CYAN\u00a0Indeed!","478":"Cyan! The shiny thing Gau spoke of is in here.","476":"Hey! I told you once, I'm not Mr. Thou!!!","474":"Phew......why'd we invite him along, anyway...?","471":"Urgh......all right......carry on......","469":"? Well, he's...... Listen when someone's talking to you!","467":"Mr. Thou's that one, over THERE!! A shiny thing, eh...? Think how jealous Locke's gonna be when he hears about this!","465":"Can anything be THAT shiny?","463":"What manner of rubbish do you suppose he's gonna...?","459":"Listen, his family was just......","449":"Shut up!!","504":"Oh, this is...","446":"Wheeze......puff......! You're pretty tough!","1349":"I have come to experience anew the love of my brother!","445":"Stop looking at me like that!","506":"The people of Doma were wiped out by the Empire...","443":"You wanna fight?","394":"Forget it. Now, come on!","392":"I'm getting sick of this! Thou art such a pain in the...! Confound it all! I'm starting to talk like you! Now listen! Just use those levers located by your hands.","1853":"Uh? Why's everyone singing?","388":"Hoo, boy... I have a great idea... Come over here.","1787":"What nonsense! You sound as if you're enjoying this!","1871":"That coin...!? BIG BROTHER!!! Don't tell me...!","390":"I'll explain later! Relax. Just climb in!","1423":"For 10 years you've treated me like a son. I am eternally grateful!","1877":"Uwaaoo! What in the...?","1087":"So...you finally hit pay dirt, eh?","1421":"Master was... Vargas...","786":"They can't get away with this! We have to strike back!","1887":"We're counting on you, Terra...","1420":"Take it! Haven't you heard? My brother says I'm a notorious spendthrift!","376":"May I give you a hand?!","379":"Let me have at it!","341":"Kefka! Wait!!!","1104":"Let\u2019s go!","1906":"Didn't I see you at Doma? ...I'm SURE I did... So that was General Leo...","587":"This can't be true... Celes...?","1184":"I know, I know...We smash Kefka, and deliver peace unto the world...","384":"Allow me to thank you! I am Sabin, from Figaro. Now, let's scram!","386":"Look... If we stick around any longer we'll have a regiment of troops down our throats.","1183":"But of course! You think a minor thing like the end of the world was gonna do me in?","1100":"Kid's got quite a lip!","1182":"If I move...The whole house'll collapse. First... save the child that's in there...I can't hold this up forever, so...Get out on the hum...urgh...","1793":"Urggggh!\u00a0(if the player has less than 500 GP)","592":"But alone...?","1797":"No one thinks you are. Just let it go.\u00a0DANCER\u00a0Stop whispering! My ears are burnin', baby!\u00a0CYAN\u00a0Enough! Have you no shame? I'll have you know...etc...etc.\u00a0NPC\u00a0Goodness!\u00a0NPC\u00a0You took one look at me and thought I was a loser, right? You're obligated to buy from me, now!\u00a0NPC\u00a0Looks like junk, but... Have any imported goods?","1098":"Yeah, right kid!","829":"We're hanging up our weapons and armor for good.","1218":"You're alive!?","678":"Yes! It's settled!","675":"Enough! If you... If Celes becomes my wife, I'll help. Otherwise...","667":"Come here.","653":"I'm a man of my word, music man!","690":"Right. I'll wait on board in case of an emergency.","662":"W...who're YOU? You're not Maria!","674":"You know...you're even more stunning than Maria.","824":"Forget that...... what's with this vibration?! Is it from the Espers?","656":"I'll deal with you in a minute!","1888":"Why'd you bring me to such an awful place!?","672":"The Empire ...evil...?","664":"Look, if you're not Maria, I don't want you aboard.","1220":"Phew... I don't know if I have it in me anymore...","1228":"......We're gonna get us another one... Airship, that is...!","1224":"That was then... We can never have that world back!","680":"Oho! Fine! I accept!","1242":"Listen to you!","1244":"Be back before sunset! I'll be waiting for you on our hill.","1245":"I restored the craft, and then put it to rest down here.","1239":"There's nothing like flying!","1247":"I put it in storage. I couldn't bear to look at it. But now it just may save us... The Falcon.","1251":"But first we need to find our friends!","684":"How...unusual! A coin with identical sides...!","1237":"Nonsense! I'll win the Falcon from you when I whip you in a race! You'd better clear outta my way!","1944":"What's the most important thing in life? Being free of obligations! Otherwise, you lose the ability to gamble...","1255":"But why?","686":"Ha! How low can you get?! I love it! All right, I'll help you. Nothing to lose but my life...","818":"What was that!?","1235":"Watch your step.","1234":"You can't be serious! What are you trying to prove?!","1910":"That landing really messed up the engine. It'll take a while to fix...","1232":"This brings back a lot of memories.","1622":"Phew! Completely lacking in fashion... Excuse me, sir. Could you order some clothes like the ones I'm wearing?","1912":"Don't touch anything!","688":"When things fall, they fall! It's all a matter of fate...","1083":"We've been had!! The Emperor is a liar!","1231":"Could be anything lurking down here, so keep your eyes peeled!","1230":"Yeah. She was a piece of work. Nothing scared her...","1227":"Thanks... I needed that. Now, let's go visit Daryl's Tomb.","1226":"Mwa ha!All right...you win! I'm starting to feel lucky!!","1222":"I'm just a gambler...I just want to be left alone...This world is too chaotic for me. What's worse, I've lost my wings...","810":"We're almost at Vector.","669":"Phew... The Empire's made me a rich man.","1725":"Don't fall! Remember, you promised me you'd do your #Maria# act again!","1914":"...... You little...!! Get outta my sight!","734":"Terra? Who's that?","732":"Right. Speaking of which... Maybe we should be leaving.","728":"We'll talk later. Let's get outta here!","1161":"Hang on!","727":"? What's up with Celes?","1117":"Quick! Let's jump onto that thing!","726":"I was starting to worry...","1917":"Actually, when I was young there was something I was mad about...","1918":"In my youth I dreamed of having the world's fastest airship.","1109":"The Empire's after the sealed gate! They're looking for some statues or something.","789":"The airship's ready!","1396":"Didn't I say it before?! This is the world's fastest ship!","791":"By all means! Take a turn at the wheel!","1897":"Repairs aren't finished yet. You'd better take the boat from Albrook.","1985":"Something good will come of it all!","1921":"... Poor Daryl...","1896":"I'll have to repair the air ship. Go scout around and let me know what's happening.","1894":"Urghh! For the time being, I don't own the skies...","1351":"My friend's airship... and her love!","1371":"Wait! Let's go that way!! Sometimes in life you just have to FEEL your way through a situation!","668":"Don't misunderstand me. I'm still not sure if I'm going to help you.","1372":"Daryl...I'm starting to sound just like you!","1332":"What's wrong? Celes......","1920":"At that time there was a young girl who piloted the Falcon, the fastest vessel ever made. Sometimes we were the worst of rivals...but other times we were the best of friends. We always egged each other on to go faster and higher. When she disappeared along with her ship... I felt like I lost my spirit.","1378":"Gogo! Watch Celes and do exactly what she does!","1726":"What a woman! Your life is hanging by a bandana!","1872":"What's going on? The Empire's becoming paranoid!","1456":"Your only hope is through Doma. I'll show you the way. Just know that I may take off at any time, if I feel like it.","1454":"They seem to have their sights set on Doma Castle.","1453":"Imperial soldiers have built a base somewhere beyond the forest.","1428":"Leave us. The dog eats strangers...","888":"I can't help you. You must look within for answers.","1950":"We meet again.","927":"Interceptor... <D>Where are you?!","885":"Thought I'd sleep out under the stars.","1819":"Leave me alone...","1951":"I'll be blown to bits before I can even collect my pay...","1818":"Just need 'nough to feed my dog. Say, oh...3000 GP.","921":"Interceptor! Come!","1457":"The Reaper is always just a step behind me...","1118":"Down with the Empire! Once I outlived my usefulness, they tried to off me!","1816":"I've worn out my welcome...","1843":"You old fool... Why throw it all away?","1817":"We meet again...","1977":"My job here's over. I've earned my fee! Ta-ta......!","887":"I didn't mean to overhear anything.","1119":"Is Interceptor all right?","1849":"There's no need for me to remain with you.","1120":"Forget about me.","1159":"Don't worry about me! Run!! I can't stop this chain reaction! I'll see you again. Count on it!","972":"Interceptor! Come!","1922":"I'm working for the Empire. But don't worry...I'm not going to garrote you!","971":"I'll search for the Espers in my own way.","1291":"First I need to see how far I can get here...","1290":"Well...","1288":"he only thing I know how to do is fight...","969":"Don't misunderstand me. I just wanted my dog back.","1753":"No need to worry. It's just a scratch. Also, he's gonna stand guard, so you just relax.","1388":"Interceptor! Get going!","1389":"Stay well...","889":"In this world are many like me who've killed their emotions. Don't forget that.","1158":"Go! There are people counting on you!","1390":"Baram! I'm going to stop running. I'm going to begin all over again...","944":"Let's get outta here! <D>I'll use a Smoke Bomb!!","1121":"I sold my skills to the Empire... I have no right to fight together with you.","1497":"...... Interceptor...are you hungry?","914":"No problem. The dog usually doesn't like people, though...","906":"Get away. He bites.","1347":"I know what friendship is... and family...","1505":"Leave 'em alone.","1506":"I have served my purpose...","699":"They drained our powers, then threw us away to... We haven't long to live...","1964":"Someone's been pretending to be me! Don't be fooled!","1503":"Uwa, ha, ha! This treasure is mine! Ta ta, cretins!","1502":"Impossible! I...I'm the greatest... But I'll still laugh last!","1199":"Pretty dangerous from here on. I'll go in first and clear out all the monsters. Wait here.","771":"Look what popped out!","692":"Get outta here!","33":"Open up! Give us back the girl and the Empire's Magitek Armor!!","34":"Open this door! We want that girl! She's an officer of the Empire!","320":"Yes, Sir!","871":"All systems A-O-K.","321":"General Leo!","322":"A carrier pigeon from Emperor Gestahl.","1459":"Who goes there?","1460":"...??? I knew I heard something...","1461":"Just a lousy cat...","318":"Y...yes Sir. Why?","324":"I understand, Sir.","326":"Yes, Sir.","316":"But, General! I'm ready to lay my life down at any time for the Empire!","328":"Sir! Leave it to us, Sir!\u00a0LEO\u00a0Right.","314":"General. We're ready to take the castle. Just give the order...","312":"General Leo. The citizens of Doma seem to be playing a waiting game...","336":"But, General Leo said...","338":"Some of our people are prisoners inside the castle! If we poison the river...","375":"The enemy! Get ready, everyone!","1873":"Returner scum!","122":"It's the Empire! It's Kefka!","128":"Yes, Sir!","1407":"...more soup...'n...","134":"Figaro Submerge Mode engaged!","523":"But Narshe is neutral...","521":"Lord Kefka! There're civilians here...!","165":"King Edgar! Where are you headed?","168":"Yes, Sir! Take care!","387":"Got 'em! Over here!","264":"...'n some bread, too... Mumble Mumble...","395":"Hey! What are you doing?","288":"Hey, have you heard?","301":"I hate that weirdo, Kefka. I don't even think he's human, not like General Leo...","293":"Shhhhh! What if he hears you? You'll be jailed!","297":"Yes, Sir. You're Kefka, correct? How are you, Sir?","291":"If he drives General Leo out of our battalion, he'll probably become the next general!","300":"Shhhh! Do I always have to tell you to keep it down?! You're hopeless...!","290":"Shhh! Quiet down. If Kefka catches us, we're toast.","299":"Phew...! Someone's gotta put that guy away! I'd like to tell him to his face he's no General Leo!","295":"Uh, oh... Here he comes... Back to the waiting zone!","294":"Alright, alright!","292":"Don't make me laugh! If someone like him becomes a general, I'll go home!","289":"Oh, you mean...","92":"Yes, Sir! All set, Sir!","1864":"Off limits! Please turn around.","1967":"Don't press the wrong switch, or...","645":"The Impresario asked me to have you press the far right switch.","1983":"Hey everyone! Let me see the light in your eyes! The old man, here, hasn't given up yet!","1934":"I didn't really quit! It's just that, well, the monster lives only on Ebot's Rock, which has been submerged for some time.","1942":"In all my travels, and in all my years...","1927":"What a beautiful day.","993":"Relm! I told you to stay at home!","943":"Relm!!! Where are you?!","916":"This is just a back-water village. We can tell you nothing about your Espers...","915":"Please excuse her. She's just young.","913":"This is terrible...","912":"Hoo boy... Seems to like your dog...","909":"Please...leave us!","907":"Go to your room!","904":"Yaa! Hush!","1008":"At any rate, come here!","902":"What in blazes... What're you doing?","1011":"All right all ready! If you insist...","920":"Sorry I couldn't have been more helpful!","1014":"What about you?","1018":"I sense some immense magical power in Terra... It...frightens me...","899":"Espers? Espers...Hmm...Not really familiar with that word.","1021":"You're the Espers that fled through the sealed gate?","1027":"There must be something in your world that allows you to focus your power differently. You must use caution while in our world...","1092":"May I accompany you?","1096":"We must expect the Empire to flex its new-found muscle soon.","1102":"All right all ready! If you insist...","1115":"The beginning of all magic...","1116":"It is said that they somehow neutralized each other's power, then sealed themselves away... the 3 statues should ever be moved out of alignment, the resulting inbalance of power would... ...rearrange the face of our planet...","1281":"Relm! Is that you, my dear? You're alive!!","901":"Nope, uhn uhn... Can't say I have. Honestly can't say I have!","1285":"You're as foul-mouthed as ever, bless your heart!","923":"This is awful! Relm...she's...","925":"Yes! She was at a neighbor's house when a fire broke out. I won't be able to stand it if something happens to her!","942":"Hurry! We have to find Relm!","936":"I'm going in!","945":"Are you okay?","947":"Save your thanks for these people.\u00a0RELM\u00a0Thank you...","949":"I guess our town's little secret is out now...","951":"This is......the village of the Mage Warriors...","952":"Long ago humans used Magicite to gain magical powers. They came to be known as Mage Warriors.","954":"After the War of the Magi, the Espers fled to their new world behind the sealed gate. They wished to live peacefully, without fear of being used by humans. They left us here to fend for ourselves\u2026 But we were despised by normal people. Everyone felt we had begun that war... They sent people to hunt us down like animals. There weren't even any trials...","934":"It's no use. The fire's too strong!","956":"A few Mage Warriors escaped and found their way here. They were our ancestors. Our powers have weakened over time, but some of it remains.","983":"Legend has it that they're hidden somewhere beyond the reach of humans. I'd say they're beyond the sealed gate...","931":"I don't care! Relm's inside!!!","959":"Well, I owe you for saving Relm. I'll help you find your Espers.","961":"I don't think so.","964":"Hmm...If they're here, they must be hiding in the mountains to the west.","966":"Those mountains have powerful magical properties. They say the Espers were created there...","928":"Relm's inside that house!","973":"I can't believe it... The Statues...!\u00a0TERRA\u00a0\"The\" Statues?!","976":"They quite literally created magic, as we know it.","978":"You could say that.","926":"Please! Won't you help?!","980":"The Statues are the source of all magic. It's said the Espers made these images, and put them in a very special place. These represent power beyond all comprehension...","958":"So, you're after the Espers, eh...?","1287":"Whoa! Well I'll be... All right, make room for me!","1283":"Oh...I'm so happy...","939":"Fool! I may be old, but I'm not powerless!","1387":"Relm! How can you be thinking about pictures at a time like this?!","1391":"No...NO!!!! A \"kid\" like me doesn't know the meaning of defeat!","1352":"I have a special little Granddaughter!","1336":"The Espers...and magic, too, will most definitely disappear from this world.","1558":"Time to relax! Home sweet home!","1385":"No! Anything but that!","1561":"Who did this to you?","1563":"You took on Hidon...?","1567":"Well... I spent my youth chasing that creature. To do it again at this age is more than I bargained for.","1568":"Gungho... rest easy, I'll do it for you!","1570":"I spent too many years of my life hunting that thing. It is my obsession, not yours.","1572":"Sorry, Relm. I'm so grateful that you care! But as its name implies, the Hidon is extremely difficult to find. Unless I go alone, it will not show itself.","1573":"Next stop, Ebot's Rock.","1560":"Gungho, wake up!","1383":"Sorry, dear...\u00a0RELM\u00a0If I hear even a peep out of you, I'm gonna draw your portrait!","1590":"I stared Hidon straight in the eye, lifted my staff, and let him have it! G'Pow!! Thwack!! Crash!!","1591":"I wanted to show my enemy the true meaning of the word, \"hero\"!","1589":"There I was, in a cave that seemed endless. Then, before I knew it, Hidon appeared!","1585":"Ho, ho, ho! If I didn't know better, I'd say that Hidon wasn't my only enemy!","1582":"Listen to me! I DEFEATED Hidon!","1587":"Ho, ho, ho!! ...by the way, how are your wounds healing, Gungho?","1579":"I did it! I...I...I actually beat Hidon!","1578":"That's Hidon!","1592":"And then......","1580":"I have to tell Gungho he is avenged!","81":"Hmm...I suppose a normal girl would have found him dashing. But I'm hardly...normal...","119":"But how will I know which way is right...","117":"I don't understand... What should I do?","143":"......... Sorry......I...... um......","115":"Empire...but I'm a soldier of the Empire...!","111":"You're Locke, right? Edgar told me about you. Is it true you're a thief?","79":"......? What's with you, anyway?","1971":"Everyone's calling me.","71":"Who do you think you are?","66":"A man said my memory would come back...","1968":"Love between a human and an Esper...","64":"Uhh...I can't remember anything...past or present...","62":"You...saved me?","924":"Relm's in danger?","35":"Empire...? Magitek Armor...?","1978":"General Leo... I believe I understand what you're trying to say.","1974":"Come with me!","77":"Look, why are you helping me? Is it because of my...abilities?","918":"Let's have a look around.","229":"Ewww!! Something's stuck to my leg!","886":"Did you hear... ...what we were just talking about?","937":"Wait...I'm going too.","795":"To the Esper World...?","204":"That's a lie!!!","210":"But...I have no significant \"other\" in my life...","790":"Come on!","787":"What's happening in Narshe?","783":"I'm the product of an Esper and a human... That's where I got my powers... Now I understand... I finally feel I can begin to control this power of mine...","782":"That was my father...?","736":"I remember it all... I was raised in the Esper's world.","551":"Huh? W......what's going on......? What!? What am I feeling?! Please......tell me! Who am I? WHO?!","535":"Have you...loved anyone?","533":"You...can use magic, too?","518":"I was also an Imperial soldier.","1916":"You love this ship, more than anything, huh?","278":"What's that...?","276":"When Locke first helped me, he fiddled with something right around here.","1919":"You mean......","189":"Younger... \"brother\"? At first glance I thought he was some bodybuilder who had strayed from his gym...","161":"What should I do...?","158":"I haven't the foggiest! It just seems natural to me that I have the use of this power...","799":"I'll do it. I'm the only one who can!","884":"Who is it?","883":"But...I want to know what love is...now!","881":"But...I haven't felt that way yet...","879":"I'm the product of a human and an Esper...Will I ever be able to love someone?","877":"What...what's with you?","1883":"I can do it... But why do I feel so wretched?","875":"Funny, isn't it... I was used by the Empire... even had my thoughts ripped from me... But here I am cooperating with the \"enemy\"...","858":"Locke... Thank you...","215":"He's badly wounded!","822":"No......Stop...! Please, don't go!!","821":"They were mad......","814":"It was......glowing!","812":"I can feel it......It's coming closer and closer...","809":"Look, let's return to the airship.","153":"Was that a bad person? I... I'm scared...","805":"Espers... Please heed my call...","1937":"I'm all right. I'm sure peace is within our grasp!","800":"Let's get this over with.","1889":"...the Espers... Something happened...","147":"Thank you, Locke! Thank you, Edgar!","1615":"How do you like these? Wait! What about those? Hm...oh well...","1616":"Did you say something?","1300":"Phunbaba's an ancient demon who was released when the world was undone.","1299":"I can honestly say I don't know what's going on inside of me...And the more I try to understand it, the less inclined I am to fight.","1298":"I don't know why these kids need me...But they've made me feel things I've never felt before. The moment I sensed this, I lost my will to fight.","1774":"You mean there's some connection between Espers and Magitek?","1295":"There were only children here... The moment I arrived, I felt needed...","1294":"The very day the world fell, Kefka turned some kind of beam on this town. Almost all of the adults perished trying to save their children...","1301":"I've really lost it...
